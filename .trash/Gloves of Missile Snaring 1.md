When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 +your Dexterity modifier. provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
