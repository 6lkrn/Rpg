# **Combat Difficulty:** 

**Easy:** Doesn't tax the character's resources or put them in serious peril. They might lost a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed
**Medium:** One or two scary moments for the players, but they should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources
**Hard:** Could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken down, with a slim chance some might die.
**Deadly:** Could be lethal for one or more players. Survival requires good tactics and quick thinking; the party risks defeat.
 
# **Steps For Balancing Combat:** 

1.  Determine XP Thresholds (do for each player)

2.  Determine Party Threshold (add each player together, do for each difficulty)

3.  Total Monster's XP

4.  Modify XP for multiple monsters

    1.  Example: 2 dire wolves (200xp each) = 600xp (2 x 200x 1.5)
