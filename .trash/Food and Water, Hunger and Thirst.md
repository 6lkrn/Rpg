Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

## **Food:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p><p> </p><p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p><p> </p><p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Water:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p><p> </p><p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

##  **Food and Water Needs by Creature Size:**

|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Creature Size** | **Food Per Day** | **Water Per Day** | **(Hot)**   |
| Tiny              | 1/4 pound        | 1/4 gallon        | 1/2 gallon  |
| Small             | 1 pound          | 1 gallon          | 2 gallons   |
| Medium            | 1 pound          | 1 gallon          | 2 gallons   |
| Large             | 4 pounds         | 4 gallons         | 8 gallons   |
| Huge              | 16 pounds        | 16 gallons        | 32 gallons  |
| Gargantuan        | 64 pounds        | 64 gallons        | 128 gallons |

## **Quick Reference: Exhaustion:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p><strong><u>Level Effect</u></strong></p></blockquote><ol type="1"><li><blockquote><p>Disadvantage on ability checks</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Speed halved</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Hit point maximum halved</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Speed reduced to 0</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Death</p></blockquote></li></ol><p> </p><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
