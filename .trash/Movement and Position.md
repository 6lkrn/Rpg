## **Movement and Position:**

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

## **Interacting with Objects Around You:**

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
• draw or sheathe a sword
• open or close a door
• withdraw a potion from your backpack
• pick up a dropped axe
• take a bauble from a table
• remove a ring from your finger
• stuff some food into your mouth
• plant a banner in the ground
• fish a few coins from your belt pouch
• drink all the ale in a flagon
• throw a lever or a switch
• pull a torch from a sconce
• take a book from a shelf you can reach
• extinguish a small flame
• don a mask
• pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
• put your ear to a door
• kick a small stone
• turn a key in a lock
• tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
• hand an item to another character

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

The “Special Types of Movement” section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for [Climbing, Swimming, Crawling, and Jumping] 

## **Breaking Up Your Move:**

## **Difficult Terrain:**

## **Being Prone:**

## **Moving Around Other Creatures:**

In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’sRho space is difficult terrain for you.</p><p> </p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.</p><p> </p><p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Flying Movement:**

| Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell. |
