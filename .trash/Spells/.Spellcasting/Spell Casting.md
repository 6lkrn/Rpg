When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

 

# **CASTING TIME**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

 

# **BONUS ACTION**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. |

 

 

# **REACTIONS**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. |

 

 

# **LONGER CASTING TIMES**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over. |

 

 

# **RANGE**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like <strong>magic missile</strong>, the target is a creature. For a spell like <strong>fireball</strong>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p><p> </p><p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <strong>shield</strong> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p><p> </p><p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in the this chapter).</p><p> </p><p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

 

# **CASTING IN ARMOR**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spell-casting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spell-casting. |
