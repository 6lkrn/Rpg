## **Damage**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&amp;D. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a <strong>fireball</strong> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Healing:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a '<strong>Potion of Healing' [ 2d4 + 2]</strong> can remove damage in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p> </p><p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the <strong>revivify</strong> spell has restored it to life.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Hit Points:**

## **Damage Rolls:**

# **Critical Hits**
## **Player Critical Success / Hit:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit:</p><p> </p><p>When you score a critical hit, <strong>you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together</strong>. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. <strong>If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</strong></p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Critical Failure:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, <strong>the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC</strong>.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

| Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious. |
