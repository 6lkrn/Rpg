Everybody believes House Cannith stopped making Warforged after the Great War. Truth is, they didn't. Warforged are still being made. They're just in disguise as common, ordinary things you see every day, like wagons, stalls, shops and carts. An entire army of Warforged Titans just sitting there, waiting to transform when the next Great War starts.

You laugh, but it's true, I tell ya! I seen it! That red-and-blue freighter over there transformed the other day, told me his name! Optical Pine or something.
