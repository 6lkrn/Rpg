<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="cube-of-force"><strong>CUBE OF FORCE</strong></h1><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p> </p><p>You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.</p><p> </p><p>If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p><strong>CUBE OF FORCE FACES</strong></p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Face</strong></td><td><strong>Charges</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Nonliving matter can't pass through the barrier.
