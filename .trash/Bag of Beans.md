The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.</p><p> </p><p>If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>D100</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>01</td><td>5d4 toadstools sprout.
