Elven (commonly called Elvish and sometimes referred to as the True Tongue) was the language (or language family) of the Tel'Quessir (e.g., eladrin, elves, and [[Drow|drow]]).

Its script was known as Espruar.

This dialect, spoken by sylvan elves, was highly musical. It sounded strange to other elves, but could be understood by them with some difficulty.Appendix
