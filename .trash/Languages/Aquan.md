Aquan was the language of the Elemental Plane of Water.

Aquan was a flowing language full of subtleties of meaning. Aquatic elves, hadozee, merfolk, tritons, water [[Genasi]], and locathah all spoke Aquan.

In the late 15th century DR, it was considered a dialect of [[Primordial]], so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as [[Auran]], [[Ignan]] or [[Terran]] could understand Aquan and vice-versa.
