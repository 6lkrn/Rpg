Primordial was the language of primordials and elementals. The Giant language was a debased form of it. The Abyssal language was a form of Primordial warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss.

It was also considered a language family, so that the elemental languages [[Aquan]], [[Auran]], [[Ignan]], and [[Terran]] were considered a group of dialects of Primordial. They were sufficiently similar that creatures who understood one of those dialects could understand the others as well.

Primordial used the Barazhad script or the [[Dwarvish]] script.
