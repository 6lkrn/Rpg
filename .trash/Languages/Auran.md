Auran was a breathy, relaxed language that has been described as a slow exhaling of air.

It was considered a dialect of [[Primordial]], so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as [[Aquan]], [[Ignan]] or [[Terran]] could understand Auran and vice-versa.

In addition to creatures native to the [[Plane of Air]], Auran was sometimes spoken by [[Settings/Faerun/Races/Air genasi]] and smoke drakes [[Kenku]] could understand Auran, but could only produce speech through mimicry.
