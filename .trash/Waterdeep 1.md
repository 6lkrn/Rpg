**Major City**: [[Locations/Waterdeep/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]] is the New York of the Forgotten Realms. Of course there’s a place to rest, stock up, and upgrade.

I won't use the suggested encounter in *Storm King’s Thunder*, because there are so many more opportunities for other kinds of micro-world building. I barely scratched the cannon modules alone let along what's in the Dungeon Masters Guild. I also won't connect the Yawning Portal with the dungeons in *Tales of the Yawning Portal* because there's already one set in there: Undermountain.

Wizards set out an elaborate mega-dungeon during 4th Edition with their *Halls of Undermountain* module. Of course, this is actually the first floor of all of Undermountain, for those who know the dungeon. I have this module in my archives and will refer to it when the party starts going down there.

**[[Teleportation Circle|Teleportation Circle]]:** What better place to hide a [[Teleportation Circle|teleportation circle]] than a cemetery, right? At least Thestryl doesn’t scare easily.
