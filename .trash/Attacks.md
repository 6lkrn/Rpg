## **Actions In Combat:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p><p> </p><p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Attack Actions:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p><p> </p><p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.</p><p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Making an Attack:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p><strong>1. Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.</p></blockquote><p> </p><blockquote><p><strong>2. Determine modifiers.</strong> The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</p></blockquote><p> </p><blockquote><p><strong>3. Resolve the attack.</strong> You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack. Some attacks require a spell to be cast, and thus count as a 'Cast a Spell' action instead of an attack option.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Attack Rolls:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. <strong>If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.</strong> The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Modifiers to the Attack Rolls:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> </p><blockquote><p>The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.</p><p> </p><p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> </p><blockquote><p>You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p><p> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>[Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus] is referred to as the Attack Bonus ('Atk Bonus') on the character sheet.</strong></p><p><strong>Having this calculated for each weapon you own ahead of time will help keep combat flowing.</strong></p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>
 

## **Rolling a 1 or 20:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Melee Attack (Attack Action):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p><p> </p><p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. <strong>You are proficient with your unarmed strikes</strong>.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Ranged Attack (Attack Action):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 id="range"><strong>Range</strong></h2><blockquote><p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p></blockquote><p> </p><blockquote><p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><h2 id="ranged-attacks-in-close-combat"><strong>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, <strong>you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you</strong> and who isn’t incapacitated.</p></blockquote><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Grappling (Attack Action):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Escaping a Grapple.</strong> A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature.</strong> When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Shoving a Creature (Attack Action):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p> </p><p>The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.</p><p> </p><p>You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>When you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple or shove someone, are you making an attack roll?</strong></p><p>Again, the answer is no. That check is an ability check, so game effects tied to attack rolls don’t apply to it. Going back to an earlier question, the hex spell could be used to diminish a grappler’s effectiveness. And if the grappler’s target is under the effect of the Dodge action, that action doesn’t inhibit the grapple, since Dodge doesn’t affect ability checks.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Unarmed Strike (Attack Action):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. <strong>You are proficient with your unarmed strikes</strong>.<br />

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Addressing a nuance in the PH errata: the rule lets melee weapon attacks use unarmed strikes, despite those strikes not technically being weapons.</p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.sageadvice.eu/2015/06/11/melee-weapon-stunning-strike-errata-explained/">http://www.sageadvice.eu/2015/06/11/melee-weapon-stunning-strike-errata-explained/</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
