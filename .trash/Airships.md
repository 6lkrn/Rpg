I mentioned earlier that there is a possibility for Airships, which means that I'll be looking into a campaign to build modern (Modern for 5th Edition era Forgotten Realms, that is) airships and places for them. Airships will ultimately be a part in all of my campaign settings, so they'll be developed more in Æthercoil Magazine, but I can think of a quick way to place airports and a ship company in the Forgotten Realms.

Make that two, in fact. This is where Elves and Dwarves will come into a classic competition. I could see both groups explore Anauroch to delve into Nethril Crypts and rediscover how to build a floating ship.

I see the Dwarvish Construction Company take up shop in Deadsnows, which is a classic Dwarven location that needs some more life. The missing Icespear Clan member might just be the person who founds this company, in a way to bring back his clan to prominence.

The Elvish Company will be in a place that is a bit more private and just a bit out of the Chapter 3 Map: Everska. The Moon Elves there would find a place between the Greycloak Hills and set up their construction there, out of the prying eyes of Dwarves…and other race's eyes. Everska's natural defenses will keep people from stumbling into the place.

A homemade module that chronicles such a discovery can be made using either group; which one might depend on the party makeup. Elves and Dwarves don't always get along. The DM should make a choice by considering the majority of the races in the party, although I'd default on 'The Icespear Airship Company.'
