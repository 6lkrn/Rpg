## **LEVEL**

<table><tbody><td><p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <strong>experience points</strong>(XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p></td></tbody></table>

 **HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p><p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <strong>hit point maximum</strong>.</p><p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting”).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

## **PROFICIENCY BONUS**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Attack rolls with spells you cast</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Saving throws you’re proficient in</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</p></blockquote></li></ul>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Determine Ability Scores**

<table><tbody><td><p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Strength</strong></td><td>Measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Dexterity</strong></td><td>Measuring agility, reflexes, and balance</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Constitution</strong></td><td>Measuring endurance (health, stamina, and vital force.)</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Intelligence</strong></td><td>Measuring reasoning and memory</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Wisdom</strong></td><td>Measuring perception and insight</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Charisma</strong></td><td>Measuring force of personality</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Standard Array
<p>Most convenient way to assign ability scores. Best for new comers or people that want to quickly generate a character without rolling dice or counting points. Assign the following numbers to your abilities in any order you wish - <strong>15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8</strong>.</p>

## 4d6 Drop Lowest

<p>You generate your character’s six <strong>ability scores</strong> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.</p>

## Point Buy

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>The last method you can use to determine ability scores is Point Buy (DM's discretion), this method provides the player with more freedom without having to brave the dangers of dice rolls. </p><p> With this method, you have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You also can’t have a score lower than 8.</p><p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h2 id="ability-score-point-cost"><strong>Ability Score Point Cost</strong></h2><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Score</strong></td><td><strong>Cost</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
