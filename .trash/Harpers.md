The Harpers are the information brokers of the group. If the party receives a message from a far-off party, gets a tip about a quest, or has someone tell them of a clue when they're stuck, chances are that a Harper had a hand in giving it to the party.

I see the Harpers not only man inns and taverns, but also libraries. The Harpers would be more bullish on literacy than the Alliance, and while major cities might have an education system to get their citizens to read, the Harpers are more known to spread that into lesser traveled venues. Most Mission Houses surrounding the region would have their books supplied by Harpers, and the group might have authored several general books for public consumption.

The Harpers version of the Boy Scout Handbook, anyone?
