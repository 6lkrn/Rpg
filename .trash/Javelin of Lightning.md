**Javelin of Lightning**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="javelin-of-lightning"><strong>JAVELIN OF LIGHTNING</strong></h1><p><em>Weapon (javelin), uncommon</em></p><p> </p><p>This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.</p><p> </p><p>The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
