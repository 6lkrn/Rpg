**Vorpal Sword**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="vorpal-sword"><strong>VORPAL SWORD</strong></h1><p><em>Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p><p> </p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p><p> </p><p>When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
