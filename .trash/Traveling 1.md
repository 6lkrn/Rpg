While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

# **Forced March.**                         
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for **8 hours in day**. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

# **[[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/Lists_Tables/Shopping/Mounts and Vehicles|Mounts and Vehicles]]:**
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

# **Vehicles:**
Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size|size]] of the crew, [[Ships|ships]] might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. 

# **Flying Mounts:**
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Carpet of Flying|carpet of flying]], allow you to travel more swiftly. The *Dungeon Master’s Guide* contains more information on special methods of travel.

## **Difficult Terrain (Traveling):**

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

# **Travelling Activities:**

 
**Navigate.** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a **Wisdom (Survival) check** when the DM calls for it.
 
**Draw a Map.** The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. **No ability check is required.**
 
**Track.** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a **Wisdom (Survival) check** when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for tracking.)
 
**Forage.** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a **Wisdom (Survival)** check when the DM calls for it. Must be moving at a slow or normal pace. Each character makes a separate check. On success**,** roll 1d6+wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, repeat roll for water (gallons).
