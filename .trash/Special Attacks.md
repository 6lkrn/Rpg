**Special Attacks**

**Opportunity Attacks**

Use reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that uses its movement to leave your reach.

 

**Two-Weapon Fighting**

Attack action with light melee weapon held with one hand, use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon held in the other hand. Don't add ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand strike.

 

**Grappling**

Replace an attack from the Attack action with an attempt to grapple; use free hand to make Strength (Athletics) check contested by Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check of the target. Grapple can be escaped using an action to succeed in a contested check as above. Grappled creatures can be dragged or carried, but speed is halved unless target is two or more sizes smaller than you.

 

**Shoving**

Replace an attack from the Attack action with an attempt to shove a creature - knock prone or push it back. Only one size larger, within reach. Succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check and target is pushed back 5 feet away or knocked prone.
