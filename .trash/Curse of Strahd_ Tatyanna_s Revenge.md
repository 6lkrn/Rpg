# About the campaign

From Issue 1:

 

My image of a vampire is different from what Tracy and Laura described in Curse of Strahd. I saw Strahd more in the light of various shows such as Angel, Forever Knight, Moonlight, and other shows where the Vampire has some heroic qualities that balance out the monster they are. In this light, I made Strahd into an Anti-Villian who watches over Barovia in a more hands-on variant of what Sorin Markov did with Innistrad. In fact, I included parts of Plane Shift: Innistrad into Curse of Strahd, especially with Strahd’s origin.

Because I wanted Strahd to be more three-dimensional, even heroic in parts. To this end, I needed a rather nasty opponent. In an object application of “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,” I created one in, of all people, Tatyanna. In my version of Curse of Strahd, she returns to Ravenloft as a vampire as powerful as Strahd and double the vindictiveness.

In this custom setting, Strahd didn’t kill [[Sergei von Zarovich|Sergei]] to get Tatyanna, but a third party led by the dragonlich Argynovost, kidnapping Tatyanna and injuring Strahd in the process, then sped away to do something nefarious to Tatyanna. It is here where Strahd made the pact that turned him into a vampire (A noble twist on his dark origins.) Strahd made short work on Argynovost’s forces, but the result with Tatyanna was the same: She was too terrified of what Strahd became, so she hurled herself into the mists, never to be seen again.

The party starts the campaign as normal, with some clues that there may be some lines Strahd doesn’t cross; he might let innocents pass, or spirit them into his castle to protect them. (Where he keeps a heard of people to feed on.) They might find Ireena having fond memories of Strahd, knowing his noble side, and even dated for a while. He might even be seen pulling off a Dexter Morgan, killing someone who is even worse than him.

It isn’t until the party gets the three treasures and faces him when they find the real villain: Tatyanna returns as a vampire believing the original version of the story—the cannon Ravenloft version. She returns to Barovia to kill Strahd, take his place as Lord of Ravenloft, and drive the whole demiplane into dust and ashes. All of the souls trapped in this realm be damned.

I only ran this version of Curse of Strahd once, but I want to develop it here.
