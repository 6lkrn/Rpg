It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +16 to hit, reach 15ft., one target.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p>Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage.</p></blockquote><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p><em><strong>Claw.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +16 to hit, reach 10ft., one target.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p>Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.</p></blockquote><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p><em><strong>Tail.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +16 to hit, reach 20ft., one target.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p>Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><em><strong>Frightful Presence.</strong></em> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).</strong></em> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.</p><ul><li><blockquote><p><strong>Lightning Breath.</strong> The dragon exhales lightning in a 120·foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Repulsion Breath.</strong> The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30·foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw.

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</p><p>In a new form , the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom , and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form , except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</p><p>![7fc695519c844f409bc44e4514c893bc](../../../../../_resources/41a3d9a1c671456a931c3c0d96635b33.png)</p><p> </p><h2 id="legendary-actions"><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></h2><p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn . The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p><ul><li><blockquote><p><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
