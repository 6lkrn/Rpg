## **Movement Action:**
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

 

## **Breaking Up Your Move:**

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

## **Moving between Attacks:**
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

## **Using Different Speeds:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.</p><p> </p><p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Difficult Terrain:**

#  

# **Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling:**

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

# **Jumping:**

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
 

# **Long Jump:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p><p> </p><p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p><p> </p><p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# **High Jump:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p><p> </p><p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# **Being Prone:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p> </p><p>To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# **Moving Past Creatures:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>You can move through <strong>a non-hostile</strong> creature’s space.</p><p> </p><p>In contrast, you can move through a <strong>hostile</strong> creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you. The <strong>overrun</strong> and <strong>tumble</strong> actions (Dungeon Master's Guide) may also allow you to cross over a hostile space.</p><p> </p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.</p><p> </p><p>If you leave a hostile creature’s <strong>reach</strong> during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack. You don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you disengage, teleport, or when something else moves you.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# **Flying Movement:**

<table><tbody><td> Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell. </td></tr></tbody></table>
