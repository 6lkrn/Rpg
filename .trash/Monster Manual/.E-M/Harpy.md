If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn to toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p><p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.</p><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

Errata:

-   Luring song: “the target can take the Dash action on its turn to move …” is now “the target must move on its turn …”

A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human female. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths.
