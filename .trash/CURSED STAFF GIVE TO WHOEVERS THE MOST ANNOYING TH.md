Every hour the staff asks 'who are you?' After the player answers the staff deals 5 necrotic damage to them. After weeks of this, or however long it takes to break the character, when it asks the question and you get a reply of 'your servant' or something that signifies they've been broken. Then the staff transforms and unlocks this potential.

Do not relent. Prod their mind. Don't let them sleep (some nights). Make them think it's a puzzle at first them drive them mad.
