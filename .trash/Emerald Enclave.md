Emerald Enclave

The Emerald Enclave, being the one who focuses on protecting the wilderness, is the conservationist group. Not only do they do Park Ranger type stuff and making sure that the wilderness is not disturbed too much by evil groups, they also step up when environmental issues are invoked. For example, it would by the Enclave that will warn the Alliance of depending too much on Oil and Coal, and some members might team up with Alliance members to create less-polluting means to generate electricity.
