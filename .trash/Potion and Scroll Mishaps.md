| **d100** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01       | The mixture creates a magical explosion, dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 feet of the mixer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02-08    | The mixture becomes an ingested poison of the DM's choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 09-15    | Both potions lose their effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16-25    | One potion loses its effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26-35    | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can't be halved in this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36-90    | Both potions work normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 91-99    | The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 100      | One one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a *potion of healing* might increase the drinker's hit points by a maximum of 4, or *oil of etherealness* might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as *dispel magic* or *remove curse,* might end this effect. |

| **d6** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1      | A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 force damage per level of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2      | The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby is the caster was the intended target.                                                                                                                      |
| 3      | The spell affects a random location within the spell's range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4      | The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a *fireball* might produce an area of harmless cold.                                                                                                                                       |
| 5      | The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell's duration, or 1d10 minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, *fireball* might cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for 1d10 minutes. |
| 6      | The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the target has moved away.    |
