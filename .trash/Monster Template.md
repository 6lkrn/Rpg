# **Overview**

In their true form, relief devils appear as small clouds of noxious black smoke shrouding 6 glowing red eyes. Relief devils rarely show their true forms, however, preferring to possess humanoids they have corrupted. They prey on the weaknesses of mortals who are overwhelmed by the responsibilities and requirements of life, offering them respite from their labors.
 
A relief devil approaches a victim first with the devil's familiar, which they usually present as a harmless animal they believe will be endearing to the target; most often, a cat or a small dog. The familiar slowly wins over the target's affections, its fiendish nature disguised by the relief devil's casting of *nystul's magic aura*. It insinates itself as a pet in the target's household while the relief devil watches constantly through the familiar's senses.
 
When the relief devil has learned all it needs to about the target, it casts *dream*, presenting itself within the target's dream in the well-loved form of its familiar. The relief devil plies the target with honeyed words, offering respite from their troubles and showing them dreaming visions of bliss and relaxation.
 
If the target at any time agrees to allow the relief devil to take on their burdens for them, even in a dream, the relief devil immediately takes possession of the target's body. The victim remains trapped in dreams of bliss that quickly become more and more horrific as the relief devil torments its host and feeds on its fear and anguish.
 
The relief devil uses the possessed body to assume the identity of the victim and slowly work to spread corruption and wickedness into everyone the victim's life touches.
 
While possessing a humanoid, the relief devil controls the victim's body and the victim remains unaware of anything save the dream tortures they are suffering. The relief devil can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The relief devil retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and access to its spellcasting and other abilities, but otherwise uses the victim's statistics. It also gains access to the victim's knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. The possession lasts until the victim falls to 0 hit points, the devil ends it as a bonus action, or until the relief devil is forced out by an effect such as the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the relief devil appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the possessed creature's body.
