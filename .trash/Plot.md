**Event Chronology**

The chronology of events at the time of [[Gwendolyn]]'s capture (two weeks prior to the party’ arrival) is as follows:

**Time Event**

08:00 PM [Derion](Derion.md) arrives at the pub, intending to stay the night
08:30 PM Sunset
08:35 PM [[Mother Gloam]] sees [Gwendolyn](Gwendolyn.md) arrive at [Albee](Albee.md)'s house and decides to kidnap her. 
10.00 PM The conspirators meet at [[Trevus]]'s house and discuss [[Mother Gloam]]’s plans.
10:30 PM The meeting breaks up; [[MacHeath]] and [[Dougal]] keep a watch on [[Albee]]'s house; [[Mother Gloam]] goes to the old ruins to consult with the dragon
03:30 AM [[Mother Gloam]] joins [[MacHeath]] and [[Dougal]] near [[Albee]]'s house, waiting for [[Gwendolyn]] to leave. 
04:30 AM [[Gwendolyn]] leaves [[Albee]]'s house; using her [Sleep](Sleep.md) spell, Mother Gloam captures [[Gwendolyn]], and [[Dougal]] takes her to the old chapel and ties her up.
04:45 AM [[MacHeath]] wakes the village, saying [[Gwendolyn]] is missing; he stirs up the posse.
05:00 AM The posse heads for [[Albee]]'s house and is spotted by [[Mother Gloam]], who wakes [[Albee]] and warns him to flee; [[Albee]] escapes; [[Mother Gloam]] plants the blood-stained robe (using blood from dead sheep) and hides, noting success of plan to confuse and terrorise villagers.

This information should become available to the characters only through much research.  

A number of special events occur after the party arrives in [[Caermor]]. The members of the coven have sense enough to  realise that strangers, particularly adventuring ones, pose a threat to their plans. Any new group of strangers must be evaluated in terms of potential risk.   

‘The night after the characters come to town, the coven meets at [Trevus](Trevus.md)'s shack to evaluate the group in terms of risk ([[Lane]]'s group underwent this evaluation and, rightly or wrongly, were decided to be no risk). The conspirators meet at sunset (6:30 PM), taking the shortest route that won't lead them through the characters’ or [[Lane]]s’ campsites. During the meeting, the conspirators decide on the danger posed by the characters and what is to be done about them. This decision must be made by the DM, allowing for what the conspirators might have heard and seen of the characters. It should take into account  such things as armour and weapons, group unity, and the apparent intelligence behind the characters’ actions. 

If the DM decides that the conspirators see no threat posed by the characters, then nothing comes of the meeting. On the other hand, if they see the characters as a threat, then the coven takes the next step. Either way, the meeting breaks up at 9:00 PM. with [[Dougal]] returning home, retracing his earlier route.

If the party is seen as no threat, then [[MacHeath]] returns home and [[Mother Gloam]] spends the night where she is.

If the party is seen as dangerous, then [[Mother Gloam]] returns to the pub with [[MacHeath]], carrying with her as many doses of her potion of narcolepsy as there are members in the characters group. At the pub, she and [[MacHeath]] spike a barrel of ale, which [[MacHeath]] then takes to the characters campsite, arriving at 9:30 PM. He offers the ale to the characters; he knows the people of the village and the reception they give to strangers. Will the characters have a drink with him — at his expense — as a token of good will? He uses his charisma to the utmost to persuade the characters to drink and, if necessary to  assuage any fears, he drinks with them.

When all (or as many as possible) have drunk the ale, he leaves, wishing them a good night. Of course, [MacHeath](MacHeath.md) avoids all danger until the effects of [[Mother Gloam]]'s potion wear off.  When he is gone, [[Mother Gloam]] approaches the campsite and, using whatever means seem most appropriate (possibly by using her ring of polymorph self to appear as [[Gwendolyn]]), tries to lead the party after her. If possible, she leads them into the marsh (with which she is very familiar), hoping that the combination of treacherous terrain, potion of narcolepsy; and marsh inhabitants put an end to them.

If she cannot entice the party away from their campsite, she gives up and vanishes into the night, heading for the old chapel as fast as she can run. There, she instructs the dragon to attack the party, hoping that the potion gives it all the advantage it needs to finish them. Note that the dragon will not fight to the death in this situation. If it finds itself overmatched, it withdraws, if the dragon is slain, [[Belle]] puts her own plans into action.

### After the Rescue.

If the characters succeed in rescuing [[Gwendolyn]], the adventure is still not over. [[Gwendolyn]] lets them know in no uncertain terms that she must find [[Albee]] to make sure that he is unharmed. The villagers are even harder to satisfy than [[Gwendolyn]]; even after the girl is brought back, they still want [[Albee]]’s head on a platter, unless his innocence can be proven to them. [[Albee]] and [[Gwendolyn]] are likely to elope, heading for [Sta Far](Sta%20Far.md) to start a new life together.

The problem of the coven exists separately from that posed by [[Gwendolyn]]. If the devil survives the rescue of [[Gwendolyn]], it continues to harry the characters unmercifully. If the coven still exists but the devil is killed in the rescue, Belle reveals her true self to the cult and orders them to attack the characters as soon as possible, using all the wiles they have.

Note that merely killing the members of the coven or telling the villagers about their involvement won't do the trick. The villagers would take the side of any local (except for [[Trevus]]) over an outsider. Particularly for [[Mother Gloam]] and [[MacHeath]], any evidence of guilt must be strong.

Even after the coven has been completely defeated, the PCs won't be totally free of the legacy of [[Caermor]].

Eternity is long, and [[Tiamat]] will almost certainly welcomes future opportunities for entertainment. These could be as simple as watching the PCs combat the occasional infernal creature dispatched  to hound them or as elaborate as hiring them to retrieve some item stolen by someone (or something) she does not want to confront directly. Perhaps she could even require the PCs to aid her in some political machination she has planned in the Hells. 

[[Albee]] may become a magic-user after all, and may meet the group again.
