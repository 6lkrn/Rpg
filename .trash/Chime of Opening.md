<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="chime-of-opening"><strong>CHIME OF OPENING</strong></h1><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p> </p><p>This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing 1t at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.</p><p> </p><p>The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time it cracks and becomes useless.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
