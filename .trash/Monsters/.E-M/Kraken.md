If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p></blockquote><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p><em><strong>Tentacle.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 30ft., one target.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18).

If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><em><strong>Lightning Storm.</strong></em> The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it.
