<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="eyes-of-charming"><strong>EYES OF CHARMING</strong></h1><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p> </p><p>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
