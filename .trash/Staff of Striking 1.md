<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="staff-of-striking"><strong>STAFF OF STRIKING</strong></h1><p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p> </p><p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p><p> </p><p>The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
