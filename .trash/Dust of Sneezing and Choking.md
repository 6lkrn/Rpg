<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="dust-of-sneezing-and-choking"><strong>DUST OF SNEEZING AND CHOKING</strong></h1><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p> </p><p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance , and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.</p><p> </p><p>When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it Is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
