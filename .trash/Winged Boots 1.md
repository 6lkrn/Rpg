<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="winged-boots"><strong>WINGED BOOTS</strong></h1><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p> </p><p>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land. The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
