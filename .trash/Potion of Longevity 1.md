<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="potion-of-longevity"><strong>POTION OF LONGEVITY</strong></h1><p><em>Potion, very rare</em></p><p> </p><p>When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
