The Black Network isn't as front and center as the other five, and they prefer it that way. Unless, of course, you piss them off.

A Zhent might have a presence in a shop where under-the-table deals might be made, or in some Red Light District in a major city (or all of Yatar for that matter). If there is a need for something that isn't kosher by the powers that be in town, there's a good chance that the party can find it being sold by a Zhent in some far-off corner. Dealing with these Zhents are only as a last resort, because they exact a high price, and know how to make people disappear.
