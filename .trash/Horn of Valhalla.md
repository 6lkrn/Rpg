In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics from the Monster Manual. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as The requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>D100</strong></td><td><strong>Horn Type</strong></td><td><strong>Summoned Berserker</strong></td><td><strong>Requirement</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>01-40</td><td>Silver</td><td>2d4 + 2</td><td>None</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>41-75</td><td>Brass</td><td>3d4 + 3</td><td>Proficiency with all simple weapons</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>76-90</td><td>Bronze</td><td>4d4 + 4</td><td>Proficiency with all medium armor</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>91-00</td><td>Iron</td><td>5d4 + 5</td><td>Proficiency with all martial weapons</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.
