## **Cast A Spell Action:**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. **Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action.** Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See the rules on **spellcasting**. |

# **Sage Advice:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>Can a spell with an attack roll be used as the attack in the Attack action or as part of the Extra Attack feature?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The short answer is no. As explained in the Player’s Handbook, you can take one action on your turn in combat, in addition to moving. You choose your action from the options available to everyone— options such as Attack, Cast a Spell, and Dash—or you choose from among the special actions you’ve gained from a class, a feat, or another source. If you want to cast a spell on your turn, you take the Cast a Spell action. Doing so means you’re not taking the Attack action or any other action. It is true that a number of spells, such as fire bolt and ray of frost, involve making an attack, but you can’t make such an attack without first casting the spell that delivers it. In other words, just because something involves an attack doesn’t mean the Attack action is being used.</p><p> </p><p>By extension, the Extra Attack feature (given by several classes, including the fighter and paladin) doesn’t let you cast extra attack spells. That feature specifically relies on the Attack action, not the Cast a Spell action or any other action.</p><p> </p><p>In summary, to make a spell attack, you have to first cast a spell or use a feature that creates the spell’s effect. A game feature, such as Extra Attack, that lets you make an attack doesn’t let you cast a spell unless it says it does.</p></blockquote><p><em> </em></p><strong>Is there a limit on the number of spells you can cast on your turn?</strong></p><blockquote><p>There’s no rule that says you can cast only X number of spells on your turn, but there are some practical limits. The main limiting factor is your action. Most spells require an action to cast, and unless you use a feature like the fighter’s Action Surge, you have only one action on your turn. If you cast a spell, such as healing word, with a bonus action, you can cast another spell with your action, but that other spell must be a cantrip. Keep in mind that this particular limit is specific to spells that use a bonus action. For instance, if you cast a second spell using Action Surge, you aren’t limited to casting a cantrip with it.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><em> </em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Can you also cast a reaction spell on your turn?</strong></p><blockquote><p>You sure can! Here’s a common way for it to happen: Cornelius the wizard is casting fireball on his turn, and his foe casts counterspell on him. Cornelius has counterspell prepared, so he uses his reaction to cast it and break his foe’s counterspell before it can stop fireball.</p><p> </p></blockquote><p><em> </em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Dash Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p><p> </p><p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>Can you use the Ready action to take the Dash action on someone else’s turn and then combine the Charger feat with it?</strong> </p><p> </p><p>No, since you can’t take a bonus action on someone else’s turn.</p><p> </p><p><em>From &lt;</em><a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/sageadvice_july2015">https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/sageadvice_july2015</a><em>&gt;</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Disengage Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.<br />
 </td></tr></tbody></table>
 
 ## **Dodge Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. <strong>Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.</strong> You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.<br />
 </td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Help Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p><p> </p><p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.<br />
 </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
 
 ## **Ready Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <strong>web</strong> spell and ready <strong>magic missile</strong>, your <strong>web</strong> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <strong>magic missile</strong> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>Can you delay your turn and take it later in the round?</strong></p><p>Nope. When it’s your turn, either you do something or you don’t. If you don’t want to do anything, consider taking the Dodge action so that you’ll, at least, have some extra protection.</p><p>If you want to wait to act in response to something, take the Ready action, which lets you take part of your turn later. For a variety of reasons, we didn’t include the option to delay your turn:</p><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p>Your turn involves several decisions, including where to move and what action to take. If you could delay your turn, your decision-making would possibly become slower, since you would have to consider whether you wanted to take your turn at all. Multiply that extra analysis by the number of characters and monsters in a combat, and you have the potential for many slowdowns in play.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p>The ability to delay your turn can make initiative meaningless, as characters and monsters bounce around in the initiative order. If combatants can change their place in the initiative order at will, why use initiative at all? On top of that, changing initiative can easily turn into an unwelcome chore, especially for the DM, who might have to change the initiative list over and over during a fight.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p>Being able to delay your turn can let you wreak havoc on the durations of spells and other effects, particularly any of them that last until your next turn. Simply by changing when your turn happens, you could change the length of certain spells. The way to guard against such abuse would be to create a set of additional rules that would limit your ability to change durations. The net effect? More complexity would be added to the game, and with more complexity, there is greater potential for slower play.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> </p><p>Two of our goals for combat were for it to be speedy and for initiative to matter. We didn’t want to start every combat by rolling initiative and then undermine turn order with a delay option. Moreover, we felt that toying with initiative wasn’t where the focus should be in battle. Instead, the dramatic actions of the combatants should be the focus, with turns that could happen as quickly as possible. Plus, the faster your turn ends, the sooner you get to take your next turn.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Search Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br />
 </td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Examples of Free Use Actions:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>Interacting with Objects Around You</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in</p><p>tandem with your movement and action:</p><blockquote><p>• draw or sheathe a sword</p><p>• open or close a door</p><p>• withdraw a potion from your backpack</p><p>• pick up a dropped axe</p><p>• take a bauble from a table</p><p>• remove a ring from your finger</p><p>• stuff some food into your mouth</p><p>• plant a banner in the ground</p><p>• fish a few coins from your belt pouch</p><p>• drink all the ale in a flagon</p><p>• throw a lever or a switch</p><p>• pull a torch from a sconce</p><p>• take a book from a shelf you can reach</p><p>• extinguish a small flame</p><p>• don a mask</p><p>• pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</p><p>• put your ear to a door</p><p>• kick a small stone</p><p>• turn a key in a lock</p><p>• tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</p><p>• hand an item to another character</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Use Action:**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. |

## **Free Use Action:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free</strong>, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p><p> </p><p>The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.<br />
 </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **IMPROVISING AN ACTION**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the <strong>ability scores</strong> in chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise.</p><p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
