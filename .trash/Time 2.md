## **TIME**

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand.

## **Time Scale:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p> </p><p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.</p><p> </p><p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p><p> </p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a <strong>6-second</strong> span of time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
