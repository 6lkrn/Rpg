## **Conditions:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p><p> </p><p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p><p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse.</p><p> </p><p>A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.</p><p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Blinded Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

 
## **Charmed Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</p></li><li><p>The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><ul><li><p>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Deafened Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Exhaustion:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>1</td><td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>2</td><td>Speed halved</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>3</td><td>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>4</td><td>Hit point maximum halved</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>5</td><td>Speed reduced to 0</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>6</td><td>Death</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><ul><li><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</p></li><li><p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels.</p></li><li><p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p></li><li><p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Frightened Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</p></li><li><p>The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Grappled Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p></li><li><p>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).</p></li><li><p>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Incapacitated Condition:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Invisible Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Paralyzed Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.</p></li><li><p>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</p></li><li><p>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Petrified Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.</p></li><li><p>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</p></li><li><p>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Poisoned Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Prone Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl (see Movement), unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</p></li><li><p>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</p></li><li><p>An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</p></li><li><p>Standing from prone costs half movement.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Going Prone, Standing Up:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described above.</p><p> </p><p><strong>You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.</strong> For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p> </p><p>To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Restrained Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.</p></li><li><p>The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Stunned Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.</p></li><li><p>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Unconscious Condition:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><ul><li><p>An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</p></li><li><p>The creature drops whatever its holding and falls prone.</p></li><li><p>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p></li><li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</p></li><li><p>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>
