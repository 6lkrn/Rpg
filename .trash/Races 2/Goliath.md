# **Goliath Traits**

Goliaths share a number of traits in common with each other.
**Ability Score Increase.**  Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
**Age.** Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.
**Alignment.** Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self- sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.
**Size.** Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.
**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**Natural Athlete.** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.
**Stone’s Endurance.** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
**Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
**Mountain Born.** You’re acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You’re also naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write [[Common|Common]] and Giant.

# **A Note on Goliaths:**

# **Goliath Names:**

Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.

Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.

A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds. Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.
