Walter CHECKHOV

“If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.” – Chekhov’s Law

There will come a time in any campaign, that the party might need something that they don’t have on hand. Usually this occurs before a known encounter that requires a certain weapon (especially silvered) or a puzzle that requires a mundane item to solve. When this need comes up, I’ll have Walter Chekhov appear with his [[One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Traveling]] merchant cart, finding the adventurers and selling his wares.

The party can take advantage of Walter’s cart to pick up some needed supplies, but if they’re savvy and know the reason behind “Chekhov,” they would notice the additional items that he’s selling at ten times the normal price of the item. With a name like his, those items are being sold for a facking reason!
