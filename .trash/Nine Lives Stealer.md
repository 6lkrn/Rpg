**Nine Lives Stealer**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="nine-lives-stealer"><strong>NINE LIVES STEALER</strong></h1><p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p> </p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p> </p><p>The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
