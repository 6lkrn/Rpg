<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="rod-of-lordly-might"><strong>ROD OF LORDLY MIGHT</strong></h1><p><em>Rod, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p><p> </p><p>Six Buttons. You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. ( nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Paralyze</strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure , the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Terrify</strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
