<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><h1 id="potion-of-diminution"><strong>POTION OF DIMINUTION</strong></h1><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p> </p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
