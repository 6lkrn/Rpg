# Character Creation

  

### Stats

  

Fight:

This stat determines how good a combatant a character is with whatever weapons

or fighting skills you decide your character knows. Also, they’ll be able to learn how to

use new weapons and fighting skills more easily, if given proper training.

  

Flight:

This stat determines how fast a character is—as well as how skilled they are at

evading their problems (both literally and figuratively). Characters with a high Flight stat

will be fast and tough to trap both physically and verbally.

  

Brains:

This stat determines how book-smart a character is. This will determine how

well they understand problems, how well they did or are doing in school, and how quickly

they’re able to solve academic problems.

  

Brawn:

This stat determines how much brute strength a character has. It does not 

determine how well they can fight—just how well they can lift things and how much

physical damage they can take. It also determines how physically intimidating a character

is.

  

Charm:

This stat determines how socially adept a character is and how good they are

at reading the emotions of another person or group of people. Characters with a high

Charm stat will be able to talk themselves out of tough situations and into good ones

with relative ease

  

Grit:

This stat determines how hard it is to break a character emotionally or physically.

Characters with a high Grit stat will be able to keep a level head in the worst of situations

and will be able to keep their cool even when pushed hard. Finally, this stat also determines

how street-smart a character is.

  
  
  
  

Allocating stats:

You get 6 dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. You can allocate one each to every skill. Higher dice give you higher rolls so allocate the higher number dice to your strongest stat and the lowest to your weakest.

  

Exploding Dice: 

When making checks, if your dice rolls the maximum number (i.e. 4 for a d4 or a 20 for a d20) your dice “explode”. When your dice explode, you can roll the dice again and add the results to your original roll. 

  

Adversity Token:  
Every time you fail a dice check, add an adversity token to your character sheet. You can cash in this token to add +1 to any dice check you make in the future. There is no limit to how many tokens you can add to one roll. Other players can lend you their own adversity tokens if they can narrate how they help you with the check. 

  

### Character Traits

  

Basic Details and Questions

First the player decides their character's basic details, such as their name, race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. They also have their character’s relationship with other characters in the group, and their character is ready ... after they select a few wizardly essentials that is.

  

Motivation:  
Throughout the games, your character will be going on adventures and getting up to mischief. Define what motivates them to be adventurous and the kind of child that extraordinary things happen to. 

  

Age:

As you grow up, you gain more skills and strengths. This is reflected in your stats.

You gain a pool of points equal to your age - 10. These points can be distributed into your stats as you wish. Each point gives a +1 to the result of any dice roll made for that stat.

  

Flaws:

Select two flaws that your character has. This flaw does not have any mechanical disadvantages but should instead allow you to roleplay your character and develop their personality. Flaws are negative character traits, such as being Competitive, a Loudmouth, or Rash.

  

Strengths:

Select two strengths. Strengths are special abilities such as being Lucky or having a Gross trick they can perform on command.

Wands and Brooms

Each player gets to construct their own wand by combining a type of wood (eg. Birch or Pine) with a type of core (eg. owl's feather or dragon's heartstring), with each piece giving the character a bonus to a different type of magic. Your wand gives you a +1 to magic done using a stat of your choice.

Familiars

Each character and optionally choose to have a familiar, ie. a small animal companion such as a cat, bird, or snake.  They have a psychic connection with this animal, and can instruct them to do their bidding.

  

Class Schedule

Finally each player needs to decide which classes their character is currently taking. These classes decide what kind of magic your character learns. This choice has in-game benefits. The classes determine what magic spells and abilities your character learns. Your classes will create a specific type of character so choose wisely!

  

After every session each character gets two marks to add to any class whose content they used during the adventure.  When a character gets 10 marks, they are able to learn a new spell/skill from that class.

  

Magic

  

Combat:

There is no initiative in Kids on Brooms, or rather initiative is determined by the GM as they see fit.  Once combat begins players make stat checks both to attack and defend themselves.

For instance, to physically punch a character rolls a Fight check against the defender's Grit.  Each player would roll their appropriate stat die, and if the defender beats the attacker then the attack misses.  If they roll higher however, it hits.

  

Injuries

On a hit the amount that the attacker's roll beats the defender's roll determines the actual injury the character suffers (there are no hit points in KoB).  A table determines the result, which can range from (on a roll that won by 1-3 points) a temporary injury (eg. being stunned) ... to (on a 10+ difference) death or near death.

  
  

## School Classes

List of classes you can take:

  

Charms: Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and

unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consisted of learning those sorts of

spells. Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons

were largely practical. Charms is considered a "soft option" by some when picking

N.E.W.T.-level classes.

  

DADA: Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., is the class that taught students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.

  

Herbology: Herbology is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There were at least three greenhouses, holding a variety of magical plants of varying degrees of lethality.

  

History of Magic: History of Magic is the study of magical history, which is taught by Professors Cuthburt Binss. His lessons were depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They were only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics had included Goblin Rebellions, Giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy.

  

This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a [ghost](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost), as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed. Many considered this to be the most boring Hogwarts class.

  

Potions: Potions is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It required the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures.

  

Transfiguration: Transfiguration is the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, and hence this is what this class taught. Transfiguration is a theory-based subject, including topics such as “Switching Spells” (altering only a part of some object, such as giving a human rabbit's ears); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear); and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air).

  

### Electives

Astronomy: Astronomy is the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes.

  

#### Third Year and up

  

Arithmancy: Arithmancy was a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. Arithmancy was reportedly difficult, as it required memorising or working with many charts. It was separated into normal Arithmancy and Advanced Arithmancy Studies.

  

Care of Magical Creatures: Care of Magical Creatures was a class which instructed students on how to care for magical beasts. Classes were held outside the castle.

  

Divination: Divination was the art of predicting the future. Various methods were described, including tea leaves, fire-omens, crystal balls, palmistry, cartomancy, astrology and dream interpretations. Divination was described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise branches of magic". Supporters of the subject claimed that it was an inexact science that required innate gifts like the "Inner Eye". Those opposed claimed that the subject was irrelevant and fraudulent.

  

Muggle Studies: Muggle Studies was a class which involved the study of the Muggle (non-magical) culture "from a wizarding point of view". It also included Muggle Art and Muggle Music. The only need for witches and wizards to learn about Muggle ways and means was to ensure they could blend in with Muggles while needing to do so.

  

Study of Ancient Runes: The Study of Ancient Runes was a general theoretical subject that studied ancient runic scripts. It was an elective course that could be taken by third-year students and above.

  

#### Sixth and Seventh Year

  

Alchemy: Alchemy is a composite subject between Transfiguration, Potions and Muggle Chemistry, focussed roughly on the transmutation of substances into other forms. It is an elective, only offered to NEWT level students. 

  

Apparition: Apparition is the magical form of teleportation in the wizarding world. Lessons were optional to those in the sixth and seventh years. In the wizarding world, performing Apparition required a licence and could only be legally performed by people over seventeen years of age. The described reason for the restriction was that Apparition was dangerous if done improperly: insufficient concentration could have led to body parts being left behind in an unfortunate side-effect known as splinching.

  

Although magical enchantments on the Hogwarts Castle [Hogwarts Castle](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Castle) and its grounds prevented Apparition and Disapparition there, these protections were temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practise Apparition.

## Quidditch

Team has 7 players

Special players:

Keeper: Defends the goals. Adds AC to goals area.

  

Beater: Once per turn makes an attack against another player on the field.  
On a hit, that player is unable to take an action that turn and doesnt add any bonuses to the field.

Chasers: Play with the ball, either to score or to defend. 

2 types of Chasers, defenders and attackers  
  

We split the field in 3 parts Make netball rules 

Players allowed in each third: 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Back Field|Center Field|Forward Field|
|Keeper<br><br>Defenders|Beaters<br><br>Attackers<br><br>Defenders|Attackers|

  

Keeper stays in the back third of the field 

Defenders can move between back and center thirds

And attackers can move between center and forward thirds

Bludger stays in the center

Seeker stays off the board

Just rolls dice

  

List of Actions: 

- Pass: Dex check Dc = 10+ number of enemy players in your third 
    
- Shoot: When you shoot you make a contested dex check against the keeper
    
- Intercept: Intercept is automatic when enemy fails their pass
    

  
  

Bludger get special attack 

They make an attack roll, on hit, the player drops the ball 

Every enemy in that part of the field can make an intercept roll to catch it

  

Highest number wins

  
  

Additional rules: 

- And there's a rule where you can swap your turn in initiative with a teammates
    
- If your pass gets intercepted, the person with the ball gets an automatic turn
    

  

Snitch comes out at round 10

Before the snitch comes out, Both seekers roll dice every round, each success makes the snitch come out one round earlier

  

Chasing the snitch: The roll dice to chase the snitch. 5 Successes and they catch it.

  

Spells are cheating. If caught, player gets permanently removed from the match

## Restricted Spells

These spells are not made available to students at Hogwarts through regular channels, and you can't select them through your wand core, quirks, or other features unless they explicitly say you can. They can only be learned by secretly researching them in the Restricted Section, practising them in secret in places like the Room of Requirement, or by being taught by a specialist.

Some teachers may decide that the crisis calls for some spells being introduced to students so they know what they might be up against. These special classes do not usually include a

practical component. The use of restricted spells is an indicator that a student is practising the Dark Arts. Being caught could mean expulsion.

# Potions

Potions have particular magical effects when drunk. Usually, the brewing of a potion is handled by an Intelligence check. Like spells, a potion's effects may backfire (roll upon drinking), which are a representation of the risk of incorrectly mixing ingredients as well as the chaotic nature of magic in general.

The potion's ingredients and instructions are assumed to be handwaved, as the story that is told as a result of the potion is more important than the specifics of how it is made. 

Some ingredients may be mentioned for their story potential.

Common. These potions are learned and mastered by all students at Hogwarts. They usually take an hour or two to brew and require success on an Easy ability check.  

Rare. These potions require specialised study or training. They usually take weeks or months to brew and require success on a Medium ability check.

Restricted. These potions are not made available to students at Hogwarts through regular channels. They invariably take many months to brew and require success on a Hard ability check.

  

## Common Potions

Skele-Gro

The drinker painfully and slowly, over the course of a day, regrows a bone that was previously removed, such as through the backfire of the crescerossa spell.

Backfire. The bone grows back over the course of 7 days.

  

Sleakeazy's Hair Potion

The drinker's hair is smoothed and straightened beautifully.

Backfire. The drinker's hair becomes curly instead.

  

## Rare Potions

Felix Felicis

Also called Liquid Luck, this potion takes six gruelling months to brew and requires hyper-specialised knowledge and care (represented by the GM rolling 2d20 and picking the higher number for the side effect). The drinker of this potion receives unusually good luck for an hour. Although this potion is not restricted, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions, and examinations due to its potency.

Backfire. The drinker is plagued by bad luck.

  

Mandrake Root Stew

Drinking this potion rejuvenates a petrified target.

Backfire. The target is bothered by a persistent ringing in their ears for 7 days.

Backfire. The drinker cannot stop talking, babbling wildly about everything they think about.

  

## Restricted Potions

The ingredients and instructions for restricted potions can only be learned through research in the Restricted Section, experimenting in secret, or by being taught by a specialist. The brewing of a restricted potion is an indicator that a student is practising the Dark Arts. Being caught could mean expulsion.

  

Amortentia

The drinker of the potion becomes helplessly, obsessively infatuated with the brewer. The effects last for about 7 days. The brewer can prevent the effects from affecting anyone but their intended target by mixing in a drop of their target's blood. 

Backfire. The drinker becomes violently jealous of anyone they see as a rival to the brewer's affection. 

  

Draught of Living Death

The drinker goes into a state of unconsciousness indistinguishable from death. This lasts for 7 days or until the drinker is awakened with the rennervate spell. 

Backfire. The drinker dies.

  

Polyjuice Potion

The drinker assumes the physical appearance and voice of another human for one hour. This potion requires the DNA of the target, usually through a lock of hair or fingernail clippings.

Backfire. The drinker transforms into a hybrid of the intended target and another human or an animal whose DNA was mixed into the potion accidentally.

  

# Objects of Power

Objects of power have a variety of strange and wondrous effects. These are divided into common items that might be found around Hogwarts and legendary items that are one-of-a-

kind. Legendary objects of power are items that witches and wizards have died to obtain, or been killed by jealous rivals just for possessing them. Such is their power.

  

## Common Objects

information that they might have missed.
