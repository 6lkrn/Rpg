FOR THE PLAYERS

# Conditions

The Kids cannot die, but they can suffer from Conditions. There are five Conditions, and the first four are mild: Upset, Scared, Exhausted and Injured. These conditions give a -1 on all dice rolls until they are healed. Additional Conditions are cumulative; two Conditions give -2 on all dice rolls. If four mild Conditions are marked and you take another Condition, you are Broken. If you get Broken, something really bad has happened. You are mentally or physically hurt, and you will automatically fail all dice rolls until healed.

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Conditions|Effect on All Rolls|
|Upset<br><br>Scared<br><br>Exhausted<br><br>Injured<br><br>Embarrassed<br><br>Demoralised<br><br>Sick<br><br>Manic<br><br>Starved<br><br>Discomforted<br><br>Broken|-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>-1<br><br>Automatic Failure|

  

The Conditions are also an indicator of how to play the Kid. You decide how much you want to play out your Conditions in the scenes. The Gamemaster can help you by asking questions: How do you feel? In what way are you Upset? You should never be forced to play your Condition if you don’t want to do so.

  

# Troubles

Trouble is something that prevents Kids from doing something; it can be a bad thing about to happen or a possibility fraught with danger. Your Kid will use skills and talents to get out of trouble. This comes in the form of a dice roll. Depending on the difficulty, more than once success might be necessary. When dealing with trouble, you describe what you will be doing and the Gamemaster will determine what kind of roll is necessary to do that. The result of your roll decides the outcome with higher results offering better outcomes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Trouble|Successes Required|
|Difficult|1|
|Extremely Difficult|2|
|Almost Impossible|3|

Experience

At the end of the session, the Gamemaster will distribute Experience Points (XP) to the Kids. These can be used to raise skills. It costs five XP to raise a skill by one and two XP to raise a talent by one.

Stats determine the base abilities and capabilities of your Kid. This is covered in more detail later. The total of your stats always = your age.

  

### Skills

Skills depend on your stats. I.e. Intimidation= 5 because his Physical = 5. 

### Key Skills

Your Kid additionally gains +3 in their key skills. For example, in the image under skills, the Kid has 8 in force which comes from his Phys+Key Skill Modifier (5+3=8).   

Creating a Kid

Each player creates a Kid. The process is shown step by-step and then explained more thoroughly.

  

# Types of Kids

Below are the types of kids available for character creation.

  

## STRANGE KIDS

  

### Nomad

You never fit a clique or a group, but somehow people just love you and everyone recognises you immediately. Be it the bullies, the nerds, the cool kids, teachers, janitors. You name it, they’ll know you, because of this you became some sort of a liaison for the cliques. If, say, one kid from another clique wants to know something about a kid in another clique, you’re the one they ask to introduce them. While everyone accepts you, you still look for a place you can call home and people you can call family. (Zen)

  

KEY SKILLS: Charm, Knowledge, Language

ICONIC ITEM: 

■ Walkman

### Crystal Boy/Girl

You strongly believe that the lives, destinies and fates are determined by the position of the stars at a certain time. You recognise that there is an order of things, knowing that larger forces are at play. You read up daily horoscopes on the newspaper to prepare for your day and expect things to happen the way it should be. You avoid certain people for their bad energy, but people avoid you for being a little strange. Sometimes you give unsolicited advice to people to help them with their day, and even if they act like they don’t believe they still compulsively listen to you -Petai

The people at school call you weird and some are even afraid of you, afraid that you’ll cast hex on them. You often giggled at this, you don’t cast hex on someone for them to unlucky, you cast another spell altogether. Silly mortals.

###   
Prefect

If the administrators and the teachers are the ones making the law, you are the one expected to uphold it and make sure the other kids do, as well.

(Tauhu)

ICONIC ITEM:

As your Master/Sensei always says; “Martial arts are only for self-defense, do not use it to bully others”.

However, by breaking and reassembling these toys, you have the proper skills for machinery and the tools needed  either to break into a lock, or to jury rig a camera onto a toy plane/car. “If it has gears in it, I can break it” is your motto.

## 2. Decide your age, from 10 to 15 years. 

  

AGE: In this game, your character is between 10 and 15 years old. Choose your age freely. 

  

YOUR BIRTHDAY: Determine freely what the date of your birthday is. 

  

GROWING OLDER: When you turn a year older, you gain another stat point to spend. When you turn 16 years old, you are no longer a Kid for the purposes of this game. Time to make a new character. 

  

## 3. Determine Luck Points. 

In this game, younger Kids are luckier than older ones. You can use one Luck Point to either give advantage to your next roll or to re-roll your last roll. You start the game with a number of Luck Points equal to 15 minus your age. Your Luck Points are replenished at the beginning of every session. You cannot save Luck Points from one session to another and you can never go above your starting number. When you turn a year older, your maximum number of Luck Points is permanently reduced by one.

## 4. Distribute Stat points. 

Distribute points between your attributes (Phys, Dex, etc). The maximum amount you can add to each attribute at the start is 5. Add a further +3 to all your key skills. This number symbolises the modifier you add to your roll. You distribute a number of points = your age.

  

### STATS

  

## Physical

■ Force - Lifting things, moving things, jumping high and any other similar physical activity

■ Intimidation - Being a big strong kid is one of the best ways to be a bully.

  

## Sturdiness

 ( NONE OF THESE WILL BE KEY SKILLS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADD THEM TO YOUR CHAR SHEET)

■ Endurance - Ability to run, climb and complete other physical activities for long periods of time. 

■ Conditioning - Every 2 points in Conditioning increase the number of conditions you can have before you are broken.

  

## Dexterity

## Skills

## 5. Pick an Iconic Item. 

Choose one of the items available for your class or come up with your own.

  

ICONIC ITEM: You start the game with one Iconic Item that says something about who you are. This Item gives you +2 in a situation where it can be used to help you to overcome any trouble. The Iconic Item will not disappear or break whatever happens, unless you want it to. If it gets stolen or lost, you’ll find it before the end of the Mystery. The Iconic Item cannot be used by other Kids. 

  

OTHER ITEMS: Some Items can be useful to overcome Trouble. Items can give a bonus to the dice roll, from +1 up to +3. To get a bonus from an Item, it must be obvious how it is of use to you. A skateboard gives a bonus when you’re fleeing from a bully in the street, but not when climbing a tree. 

The Gamemaster should disallow unreasonable attempts to use Items. The Gamemaster decides which objects are Items that give a bonus and which are just props. 

  

GAINING NEW ITEMS: You may find or build things, or train Creatures, to get new Items during a Mystery. The Gamemaster gives the Item a bonus of +1 to +3, depending on how powerful it is deemed to be. You may choose to replace your Iconic Item with a different item that you have found. The new Iconic Item gets a bonus value of +2 no matter what value it had previously.

  

LOSING ITEMS: Items can be lost, stolen, damaged or otherwise removed from the game at the gamemaster’s discretion. (Iconic Items are an exception).

  

## 6. Pick a Problem. 

All Kids have a Problem. You may have kept yours to yourself or told the other Kids. The Problem is a part of Everyday Life, something that worries you. If you solve the Problem, then you must pick a new one before the next Mystery. You should choose a Problem that you want to explore during the Mysteries. It’s a signal from you to the Gamemaster: put my Kid in this kind of trouble! Think of your problem as your own Side Quest.

  

■ Nobody tells me how my dad died. 

■ My sister is really sick. 

■ That weird man is following me. 

■ The tough guys hit me. 

■ My parents are always arguing. 

■ She/he doesn’t even know I exist. 

■ Someone is poisoning our animals. 

■ Mom/dad doesn’t want to accept that she/he is sick. 

■ I seriously hurt someone by mistake. 

■ My brother refuses to go out of his room since the accident. 

■ My teacher hates me. 

■ I cannot read very well, and they want to move me to a special class. 

■ My aunt lives in our basement and she is crazy. 

■ Mom/dad is having a secret love affair. 

■ Your rival knows what you are trying to hide.

■ My parents are about to divorce. 

■ I steal money. 

■ Unrequited love.

■ My parents say that I’m good for nothing. 

■ My mother/father drinks a lot. 

■ We are short of money.

■ My brother is doing weird things in his room. 

■ I get bullied at school

  

## 7. Pick a Drive. 

Your Drive is the reason why you expose yourself to dangerous and difficult situations to solve Mysteries with your friends. It helps you to understand your Kid, and makes it easy to start a new Mystery; whatever happens, the Kids will want to figure it out. You may change your Drive between Mysteries. 

  

■ I want to find answers to the big questions in life.

■ I need something to brag about.

■ I love puzzles. 

■ Peer pressure makes me do it. 

■ There is more to this world than what meets the eye. 

■ They need me.

■ It’s the right thing to do. 

■ It’s a relief to get away from the burden of popularity. 

■ I hate secrets.

■ I’m doing it for love. 

■ Hunger for everything in life

■ I’ll do anything to get away from home. 

■ My friends and what we do is the only thing not broken in my life

■ They say I’m the most curious person alive. 

■ Drawn to anything different or strange.

  

## 8. Pick a Pride. 

Every Kid has a Pride, something that makes you feel strong, important, and valuable. Pride may be well known to the group, or a secret. Pride can even become a Problem, but it may also be two separate things. You can change your Pride between Mysteries. Once per Mystery, you may check your Pride to get one automatic critical success in a dice roll. You can check your Pride after a failed roll, or even after a successful roll. You must explain how your Pride helps you. If the Mystery takes several sessions to play, or if the group plays the Mystery Landscape, Pride may be checked once every session. 

  

EXAMPLE 

  

The Gamemaster: The hole in the ground is dark and damp, and you hear something echoing down there. When you lean in over the hole, it sounds like laughter. Mad mechanical laughter. What do you do? 

Player 1 (Olle): I back away from the hole. “I think we should find another way in.”

Player 2 (Anita): “No way.” I stare at you with firm eyes, but I’m really scared. “We are going down there, and we are going to stop that thing.” I slowly sneak down into the hole trying to move as quietly as possible. 

The Gamemaster: Roll sneak. 

Player 2: I failed, but I check my Pride, “Nothing scares me,” so I make it anyway! 

  

■ When the shit hits the fan, I don’t back down. 

■ I’m the smartest kid in school. 

■ Nothing scares me. 

■ My machines will one day conquer the world.

■ I stood up to the teacher.

■ I’m not heterosexual. 

■ Mom says that I am beautiful

  

## 9. Define your Relationships to the other Kids and to the NPCs. 

You should define your Relationships to the other Kids in the group. This is best done together with the other players. If one Kid has the Relationship “Older sister” to another Kid, the players need to agree that their Kids are, in fact, siblings. None of the Kids should be enemies, but it’s fun to have some tension in the group; love, envy or mistrust. The Relationships can be changed between Mysteries as the Kids are affected by what happens. You should also choose two Relationships to NPCs. If you want to write your own Relationships and NPCs, you need to do it together with the Gamemaster, so that those NPCs can easily be connected to the Locations in the Mystery Landscape. The NPC Relationships are meant to be a connection between the Kids and the strange things that will start happening as the game is played. 

  

Kids-

■ He/she is my competitor.

■ I will make him/her love me. 

■ We are siblings and friends.

NPC’S-

■ Mona, the school librarian, was my friend until she disappeared. I am sure that the school janitor [Jeffrey] knows more than he’s saying. 

■ Olaf in my class was attacked by animals while riding his bike home from training. I can’t believe that everyone at school thinks he was attacked by werewolves. 

■ When Lena Thelin was fired from the Facility, I heard her vow to take revenge on all who live here. 

■ My friend Lina told me that strange creatures have moved into the Cooling Towers. She thinks they are aliens. 

■ Everyone seems to be having nightmares about that horrible teenager Peter. 

■ My friend Elisabeth has built a computer program that cracks codes, and we used it to listen to a scrambled radio communication. Some guys, who called each other fish names, talked about her mother as “one of the targets.” 

■ The school janitor seems so lonely since Mona, the school librarian, disappeared. I wish I could help him. 

■ The Police officer Karen Richards asked me if we could help her out on her boat this weekend. 

■ I have seen that stranger, the former rock singer Nile Hayes, sneaking around in the forest near the company NAI. 

■ That new police officer, Karen Richards, has rented a boat to investigate something in the lake, but she hasn’t told anyone what it is.

■ The school janitor, Jeffrey, seems to hate me, but I know he is hiding something. 

■ Nobody knows it, but the former rock star Nile Hayes lives in a cottage at Väntholmen/Hemenway Park. I talked to him and he said something horrible is happening at Svartsjölandet.

■ My mom thinks that she is being followed because she’s a scientist, but dad thinks she's going crazy. 

■ My older sister has joined the Wildlife Club; now she’s stopped talking to me, and she sneaks out in the middle of the night. 

■ The strange scientist, Lena Thelin, is my aunt, but that doesn’t mean I like her

■ I wonder why the Priest in St Christopher’s bought explosives, and why his clothes are so filthy? 

■ They think I met with Nile at Väntholmen/Hemenway Park because he was famous or because I’m buying drugs, but I would never do drugs and I don’t care about fame. I actually like him, though he keeps talking about how the owner of the company NAI destroyed his life and the lives of many others. 

■ My teacher Nikolas is the only teacher I have ever liked, and now he is in the hospital and he won’t wake up from whatever nightmare he is having

All Kids have an Anchor, a person that you can go to for support, comfort and care. It can be a friend, a parent, a teacher or a neighbor. It cannot be another Kid. If you suffer from one or more Conditions (below), you can spend a scene with your Anchor and heal all Conditions. You must allow the Anchor to take care of you, and there must be a physical or mental closeness between you. The Gamemaster is not allowed to put you in Trouble in this scene. If you put yourself in Trouble, you don’t heal any Conditions. This healing will also take time and cannot be instant. (Long Rest)

  

List of Anchors - 

■ Mother/father 

■ Science teacher 

■ The guy who owns the comic shop

■ Teacher 

■ Local author

■ Fellow hunter 

■ Riding instructor 

■ Coach for the team 

■ Older sibling 

■ Mom/dad 

■ Famous friend of the family

■ Music teacher 

■ The guy at the music store

■ Janitor at school 

■ School psychologist 

■ Grandma

■ Another Kid’s mom/dad 

■ Neighbour

  

## 11. Name your Kid. 

Choose a first name, Last name and Nickname.

  

## 12. Write a short description. 

Write down something about what your Kid looks like, and what she is like as a person. You should also write down things that you find useful when you are going to play the Kid in game, such as how she talks and moves, what clothes she wears, and so forth. 

  

## 13. Define the group’s Hideout. 

The Kids have a Hideout together, where they can be alone and safe. The players should agree on what their Hideout is, and where it is located. NPCs will not find the Hideout unless the Kids show it to them.  You are safe in the hideout unless you start trouble, for example by arguing with another Kid. You can heal your Conditions in the Hideout in the same way as with using the Anchor. This requires that two or more of the Kids are present, and that they are physically or mentally close to each other, for example, hugging, telling secrets or stories or comforting one another. If the Kids put themselves in Trouble during the same scene, they don’t heal any Conditions. All Kids share the same Hideout. 

  

## 14. Answer the Gamemaster’s questions.

After all players have created a Kid, and before the game starts, the Gamemaster will ask a number of questions of you. You should answer them as honestly as you can, and from the perspective of your Kids. The Gamemaster chooses 4-6 questions from the list directed at the Kids, and distributes them one at a time, and 2-3 from the list of questions addressed to the whole group. It is the responsibility of the Gamemaster to ensure that all players get to answer questions and get roughly the same amount of focus. The Gamemaster should pick questions relevant to the one-shot/session.

  

QUESTIONS TO THE KIDS 

■ In what way has your Problem gone from bad to worse lately?

■ What do your parents do for work? 

■ What do you think about school? 

■ What is your favorite food? 

■ Do you have siblings? What do you think about them? 

■ What does your room look like? 

■ What do you dream about at night? 

■ What makes you angry? 

■ What do you want to work at when you grow up? 

■ What do you think about sports? 

■ What is your experience with robots? 

■ What is the furthest you have traveled from your home town? 

■ How are you affected by your Pride? QUESTIONS TO THE GROUP 

■ Who in the group has the most to say? 

■ When did you get to know each other? 

■ What makes you laugh? 

■ What secrets do you have? 

■ Who dislikes you? 

■ Who wants to be in the gang? 

■ What are you fighting about? 

■ Who among you is most mocked? 

■ Who is the leader? 

■ Who is in love with whom? 

■ What sets you apart from other kids? 

■ What are you not talking about? 

■ What do you like to do

# MYSTERIES

# A Mystery is a scenario for the Kids to play. Like a comic book or a TV show episode, a Mystery has characters and a plot for the players to uncover. Unlike these, a Mystery has no set chain of events which turns the story takes and how it ends depends on the choices the Kids make, and, to some extent, on chance. Most Mysteries should take a couple of hours to solve. Each Mystery has a structure that includes six phases that will help you as a Gamemaster to set scenes. The structure is also an aid for you to write your own Mysteries. Using a Mystery is the primary way to play this game, preferably for one-shots or shorter campaigns. 

# YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK TO THIS STRUCTURE.

# THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY

# The first thing you need to do when you write a Mystery is to create the Truth of the Mystery. What is the story about?

# ■ A scientist has created a time machine that he has lost control of, and he has been thrown back to the Stone Age. The hole in the fabric of time is open, and creatures wander in and out.

# ■ A gravity dissolver has accidentally fallen from an airplane and landed nearby.

# ■ The result of an unsuccessful animal experiment has been flushed down the drain and has grown to become a monster in the lake.

# ■ Three different experimental buildings randomly create a force field that makes people grow old very quickly.

# ■ A scientist puts his brain into a robot, which then flees and refuses to come back.

# ■ A machine comes to life and decides to wake more of its “species.”

# ■ A creature from another time or place is stranded and needs help to return home.

# ■ Soviet or American industrial spies try to steal the secrets of Rask Energy.

# ■ A student who hates her teacher decides to take revenge by using her tech skills.

# ■ A robot is on the run, and its “owners” want to catch it.

# ■ Criminals use technology to steal from the town residents.

# ■ A scientist tries to use runaway kids as human tissue samples in her cyborg factory.

# ■ A Dinosaur hunter and a Tyrannosaurus Rex use the forest as their battleground.

# ■ Workers at the Facility try to sabotage a new machine that will make many of them unemployed.

# ■ Environmentalists want to sabotage the fusion reactor.

# ■ Afghan Mujahedeen come to the Facility to steal or buy technology to help in the fight against the Soviet invasion.

# ■ Teenagers steal a robot and bring it to a party, but things go off the rails, and someone is badly hurt or even killed.

# ■ A kid finds a gap in the ground, which leads down to a maze of underground tunnels where he gets lost.

# ■ Some teens use an invention to cheat on their tests.

# THE MYSTERY AND EVERYDAY LIFE

# The game has two parts: the Mystery and Everyday Life.

# Your kids take part in both, often in a random order. In one scene, the Kids could be chasing a runaway robot, and in the next, they are sitting in a boring science class. It is your job as Gamemaster to mix scenes.

# Keep in mind that the Mystery is the main story. To set scenes related to Everyday Life, you need to know the Kids well, you should consult the players to get a picture of their Kids’ Problems, Prides, and Relationships.  You can also use the Gamemasters questions.

# Scenes related to Everyday Life illustrate normal suburban life, as a contrast to the stunning events of the Mystery. You should use Everyday Life scenes to give clues about the mystery or to help develop the Kid’s character more clearly. Keep Everyday Life scenes short and succinct and try to include as many Kids as possible.

  
  

# PHASES OF THE MYSTERY

  

### PHASE 1 – INTRODUCING THE KIDS

# The Mystery always starts with each of the Kids playing a scene from Everyday Life, this scene helps a player to get to know her Kid, and shows the other players what her Kid is like. The Gamemaster may set a scene up on her own, or ask the player for a suggestion. Don’t overthink it. The Gamemaster will cut the scene when it feels done, and move on to the next Kid. These scenes should be kept rather short. After this phase, most scenes will be played with all the Kids present, acting as a group.

# EXAMPLE

# The Gamemaster: Ok, let’s start the game! It’s a damp and rainy weekend in late October. Rumors are spreading about cut-backs at the facility, and many of the adults are irritated and quiet. Outside, it is muddy and dark. Leaves cover the ground, and the cold from the lake blows in over the island with the smell of water and fish. Who gets the first scene?

# Player 1 (Jacob): Let me have it.

# The Gamemaster: Do you have an idea, or do you want me to give you a scene?

# Player 1: I have one. I am sitting in my room, grounded by mom, waiting for my father to come home and give me a scolding.

# The Gamemaster: What have you done?

# Player 1: She found me looking through her medicine bottles.

# The Gamemaster: You hear your mom walking around on the ground floor. Suddenly, she stops and at the same moment, you hear the familiar sound of your dad’s car as he parks out front. A moment later the door opens, and you hear your mom and dad talking, but you don’t hear what they’re saying. What are you doing?

# Player 1: I’m sitting on my bed sorting my Garbage Pail Kids cards and I’m mad. She totally overreacted.

# The Gamemaster: You hear your dad coming up the stairs.

### PHASE 2 – INTRODUCING THE MYSTERY

# Next, the Mystery is introduced. You let the Kids encounter or hear about something that arouses their curiosity. This usually happens in a single scene, where all the Kids are present, but it can be stretched out for several scenes. If the Mystery was introduced without all the Kids being present, you should set up a scene where everyone is present and able to talk to each other, before moving on to the next phase. Let the Kids get a little glimpse of what’s wrong or different, but they shouldn’t be shown the whole picture. Something has disappeared, something has been added that shouldn’t be there, a rumour of some kind or a problem has appeared that needs to be solved.

### PHASE 3 – SOLVING THE MYSTERY 

# This is the biggest part of the Mystery, where most of the scenes will take place. The Kids visit Locations and talk to people looking for Clues, overcoming trouble, and trying to solve the Mystery. You set scenes about the Mystery and Everyday Life, alternating between the two. In most scenes, all Kids should be present if possible. If the Kids have been split up for one or more scenes, you should set up a scene where everyone is present. You can simply ask the Kids, “Where do you meet up, and what do you do?”

# In most Mysteries, there will be Locations to visit and explore. Three is a good number of Locations for a one-evening Mystery but it is completely up to the Gamemaster. At each Location, there are usually some sort of Clues and/or possible trouble. Locations can be mundane or fantastic – it can be anything from a garbage dump or a school cafeteria to a robotic factory or a portal to other parts of the world

#  A Clue may be something that someone knows – a thing, a diary, a drawing, tracks in the gravel or an event that reveals something. The clue reveals something about the Mystery. Clues can be connected to each other, so that the first Clue leads to the second, that that leads to the third, which finally solves the Mystery.

# CLUES CAN REVEAL:

# ■ Where to go next

# ■ What will happen

# ■ Who is involved

# ■ Where to find more information

# ■ What has happened

# ■ How to solve the problem

# ■ How to use a strange machine or communicate with a creature

# ■ What is threatening the Kids

# ■ How to get to a certain place or time

# ■ Or something else.

# Phase 3 is the meat of the story, and you can employ many useful methods during this phase.

# COUNTDOWN. 

# Mysteries have a Countdown. This is a sort of ticking time bomb. Things will happen step by step if the Kids don’t prevent it from happening. The last step in a countdown is often something catastrophic for the community, for the Kids or for someone else.

# You advance the countdown one step at regular intervals without telling the players, and then describe the results in a scene. If the next step is that the pyromaniac sets fire to another house, you tell one of the Kids that she wakes up in the middle of the night to cries and the smell of smoke. When she looks out the window, she sees the neighbour’s house on fire. 

### PHASE 4 – SHOWDOWN

# The Showdown is the finale of the Mystery. It could be a Location, a person, an event, or all of them at the same time. The Kids have solved the Mystery, and now they must stop bad things from happening, maybe free a kidnapped child, close a portal or capture a robot or a dinosaur. Sometimes the Kids will need help from the police or other adults, but usually they need to handle the Trouble themselves. You should make sure that all the Kids are present during the Showdown, so that no player misses out on the most important scenes of the Mystery. If the Kids fail in the Showdown, sometimes they can try again. Otherwise, the Showdown ends, and the game moves on to the Aftermath. After the Showdown, if there are things that the Kids don’t understand about the Mystery. Use those things to create new Mysteries. Often the showdown will be with the villain of the story. Try to make these people nuanced. There are very few purely evil people – most have a reason to do what they do. They might feel offended, rejected or misunderstood.

### PHASE 5 – AFTERMATH

# Life moves on. After the Showdown, you should set one scene from Everyday Life for each of the Kids. The scenes take place minutes, hours or days after the Showdown. Despite the Kids’ heroism, things haven’t changed – parents are still fighting, and math tests aren’t any easier. Nobody believes the Kids when they talk about the strange things they have seen. All the evidence is destroyed or can be explained away. These scenes usually don’t contain Trouble. If the group is short on time, you can skip the scenes, and instead let the players briefly describe a snapshot of their Kid in an everyday situation.

### PHASE 6 – CHANGE

# After the Mystery, you and the players should discuss whether the Kids have changed or learned something new from the experience. Each player reads her Kid’s Problems, Pride, Iconic Item, and Relationships out loud, and changes what she likes. If the Kid solved her Problem, she chooses a new one. All Conditions are healed between Mysteries. A Kid who turns 16 moves on in life and stops playing with the Kids. The player creates a new Kid. The player may stop playing her current Kid and create a new one between Mysteries.

#### EXPERIENCE POINTS

# After the Mystery, or session, the Kids get Experience Points (XP) that the players can use to increase skill levels. Read five questions out loud to the Kids, and let the players answer them. Each Kid gets one experience point for each question answered with a “yes.” To increase a skill by one costs five XP.  The Kid can at most save 10 XP. They may only be used before or after a session, never during play.

# Example Questions

# ■ Did you participate in the session? (Every Kid that is present during a session gets at least 1 XP.)

# ■ Have you faced any trouble due to your Problem or your Relationships?

# ■ Did you use, or struggle with, your Pride?

# ■ Did you put yourself at risk for the other Kids?

# ■ Have you learned something new? (What is it?)

# Most questions should be unique to the mystery and kept secret beforehand to avoid any meta gaming. 

  

### Writing a Story

# EXAMPLE LOCATIONS AND CLUES

# ■ “Sloppy” is a twenty-year old former hockey player who lives in a ramshackle house in the woods at Mörby. He knows that it was a brother of one of the Kids who stole the robot, but he will not say it voluntarily. Sunken eyes, aggressive, and often drunk.

# ■ On the sandy beach of the lake, there are tracks in the sand from a quadruped creature that seems to have come up from the water. One of the giant lizards is hiding in the bushes, guarding its eggs. It will attack if the Kids come too close.

# ■ In a rusty MagLev ship, tools for cyborg maintenance lie neatly stacked. Someone clearly lives here, and that person appears to cooperate with the fugitive cyborgs. The tools’ owner has connected a car battery to the tools, and electrified them. The rust in the MagLev ship makes it dangerous to move around; the Kids risk falling straight through the decks down to the rocks below. 

# ■ Down in the underground passages, there is a room where the abducted boy was kept hidden. Here, the Kids find a chair with rope, empty food containers, and bags of candy, but also a hidden note that the boy left behind. With his nails, he has smeared “uncle” in dirt on a dropped handkerchief. The passages are dark and labyrinthine, and it’s easy to get lost.

# ■ At the missing scientist’s desk inside the laboratory, there is a blueprint that is difficult to understand. It reveals that the scientist is trying to construct a huge battle robot. Among the scientist’s things there is an address book with only one address, to “Sweet Maya, Stanley.” It is difficult to get past the guards and scientists to get to the desk

# TIPS FOR SETTING THE MOOD

# ■ Set the mood early in the Mystery. Then, everyone will remember it, and you don’t need to spend much time on descriptions later on. Everyone at the table gets the same feeling.

# ■ Describe (a few) details. You rarely need to describe everything that can be seen or heard, but it’s always good to describe a couple of details. The Kid’s blond hair that refuses to lie down at the back of his head, a seagull on a rock, the eyes of the cyborg.

# ■ Use all of the senses. Describe what the Kids see, hear, smell, taste, and feel.

# ■ Don’t forget the seasons and the weather. Is it summer, with golden fields of rapeseed, or fall with muddy fields? Coltsfoot growing in the sun, or a garden covered with snow? Is it windy, does it rain on the abandoned factory?

# ■ Autumn winds that sweep in with cold air from the north, outdoor furniture that gets hidden deep inside garages. In the darkness, beams of light from car headlights sweep across winding roads.

# ■ Home is where the heart is. If the parents are fighting, the house feels cold and unsafe. If there is a celebration and joy, the windows are open and the rooms feel inviting and friendly.

# ■ The Islands are surrounded by water. The wind whips up waves, the smell of freshly caught fish, and fishing boats visible in the distance. There is always an island or a rock to swim to.

# ■ Share the responsibility. You should not describe everything. Ask questions of the players, let them decide how something looks or feels. Make sure that everyone gets a chance to contribute.

# ■ The adults are remote and detached. Their conversations are uninteresting or confusing. They look at you with weary eyes when they pretend to want to listen. Restrained emotions, parties with too much alcohol, suspicious questions about your friends and activities.

# ■ Use similes. The wreck of the cargo ship is lying on its side like a wounded moose, the headmaster’s house is towering on the hill like a huge toad, the punch to your face sounds like a heavy book being dropped.

  

# Typical Twists you can add to the story:

# ■ The kidnapper is actually a good guy. He is trying to save the lives of people who will die in a horrible storm, which he has seen with his Future Goggles.

# ■ The old lade unexpectedly gives the Kids the reward, asks them to go home without having found the missing necklace. The old lady has been brainwashed by her son, who is a thief and an inventor of strange devices.

# ■ The uncle visiting one of the Kids’ families is, in fact, a robot.

# ■ The stargazing student must have been lying! It’s her blood on the knife, and now she is alone with the person she wants to murder.

# Examples of Showdowns

# ■ The mad scientist is in his hideout, and he is just about to open a black hole. Two mechanical bull-dogs guard the hideout.

# ■ The electrical storm sweeps across town and destroys all electronic devices. The Kids have to stop it with the Items they have built or found.

# ■ The ape-like creature is standing on top of the huge cooling tower, and is about to transport the building to tis home world.

# ■ The Kids finally find the corpse, half-submerged in the swamp. The killer watches them through binoculars; she will not let them leave to tell the police.

# ■ The Church crackles with energy and floats up into the air. The Kids must prevent it from dissolving into atoms.

# LUCKY BREAK. 

# If the Kids ever get stuck during the myster, they can trade in their luck points for a “divine intervention”. Something that helps them solve the Mystery and makes it possible for them to move on to the Showdown. A letter falls out of a book. The scientist’s colleague calls the parents of a Kid and tells them something important. Someone is seen driving through the village. The amount of luck points spent determine the help that they receive. 

NPCS

All Mysteries contain a couple of NPCs that will either attempt to thwart the Kids, ask them for help or help them. It’s good to mix ordinary people and creatures, like a journalist or a guard dog, with robots and dinosaurs. The NPCs are described briefly with their name, what they look like, how they behave, what they want, what Trouble they can cause, and if they have a Clue. Try to give each NPC a detail that stands out, so that the players can keep track of them – a stutter, a red cap, angry eyes or a broken tail. You should be careful with letting NPCs have guns that they use against the Kids. The players may feel compelled to arm their Kids too, and soon the Mystery is turned into a shootout.

  
  
  
  

# Seasons

When writing your Mysteries and setting your scenes, you should also consider seasons.

### SUMMER 

It’s summer break and it’s very hot. Birches, pines, ferns, and blackberry thickets cover the landscape. Mosquitoes plague those who venture out into the thickets and woods where rabbits, foxes, and deer attend to their newly born. Along the shore, one can see small fish and flies that thrive in the seaweed. Children pick flowers and sorrel, swim and play tag. Teenagers stay up all night, drink beer and race souped-up mopeds, try snuff for the first time, and make out in badly pitched tents. The gardens smell of barbecues and fresh paint on the picket fences. The Atilles flag flies from flagpoles, and the radio program Summer can be heard from the verandas at 1 pm every day. Freshly caught fish from one of the fishermen down at the harbour, home-grown new potatoes, and strawberries are eaten in large quantities. At the kiosk, the vendor tempts young and old with ice cream, frozen colas, and fresh fruits. In the ’80s, many people don’t have air conditioning in their homes, and just have to tough out the heat with electric fans or swimming pools. Some escape to the comfort of shopping malls or supermarkets for the air conditioning. On hotter days, the residents only emerge from their homes in the evening to enjoy the cooler air.

### AUTUMN 

It is cold and windy on the islands, and the rain seems to fall sideways. Dark clouds blow across the sky, and mighty thunderstorms rage in the area. The leaves are coloured red, yellow, and orange, and lie in banks on the ground. There are puddles everywhere with earthworms and frogs contained therein, and the birds fly south in arrow-shaped formations. The classroom smells of wet clothes, and the lessons seem to never end. During breaks, students stand in groups shivering or go exploring on muddy paths between bare trees. In gym class, children are forced outside to practice orienteering or running. Everyday life goes on – work and school, breakfast, supper, brushing of teeth, and alarm bells ringing. The days become shorter and darker, and the cold makes everyone don caps and gloves. Spinning bike wheels spray up mud and rainwater.

### WINTER 

It is winter on the Atilles Islands, and Christmas is just days away. It has been cold for weeks, and Lake Atilles is frozen. Skaters glide across its glossy surface, and fishermen drill holes and wait for hours with a jigging rod and a coffee thermos. On land, snow plows make high snow banks where children build caves and have snowball fights. In the mornings, cars spew black smoke while adults scrape the windows. Snowmen stand on parade in the gardens with carrot noses, and in the trees, packs with sunflower seeds and apples hang, attracting small birds. On December 13, the children and adults wake up early and go to school and work. The children walk in Lucia processions with long white robes and candles, singing solemn songs while flashes from the parents’ cameras light up the room. Afterwards, everyone eats gingerbread and saffron buns. The children make wish lists for Christmas Eve. They go sleigh-riding and skiing. Soon, the Christmas holidays starts, just a few more days to bear with Christmas crafts, games, and songs in school. Parents go through the chore of shopping for Christmas gifts.. 

The clothes are wet from melting snow and the kids’ faces are pale with red cheeks and cold, sniffling noses. The days are short and dark, and cold winds sweep in over the islands.  

### SPRING 

Winter is finally over, and the longer days are returning to the Atilles Islands. During school breaks, girls jump rope between rain puddles, and boys play field hockey. In their classes, kids are hard at work. There is much to be done before anyone can start dreaming of graduation. Coltsfoot grows in the ditches along the roads, and in the forest, the ground is covered with white anemone flowers. Chirping birds build nests in the treetops during the early part of the morning. Deer and foxes prepare for new litters, and the first yellow brimstone butterflies dance in the sunshine. Parents prepare outdoor furniture and dream of holiday. There are many more weeks of work before summer, and the short stays outdoors are interrupted by cold winds, storms with heavy rain, and cracking thunder. The farmers collect branches for bonfires which are traditionally lit at the end of April, to celebrate Walpurgis Night, a festival traditionally associated with protection from witches. Families go to watch the fire together. The air smells of life and hope. Summer is coming. 

  
  

# WORLD BUILDING  - WORK IN PROGRESS 

## HISTORY

Things are not quite as you remember them. The ’80s of this game are filled with strange technology and top secret, government-run projects. The twin large particle accelerators in Atilles and the US are still active. Robots are commonplace, vehicles use magnetic levitation and 10,000 ton gauss freighters traffic the Tundra route to Siberia. This is the era of fantasy.

In the years after the second World War, the major powers invested huge amounts of time and money in experimental research programs. Most of these yielded almost no results, but a few of them paid off handsomely.

The so-called MagLev effect was discovered by scientists in the Soviet Union, and gave birth to the majestic gauss freighters and other floating vehicles. This soon became the preferred method of transferring freight around the world. MagLev stands for Magnetic Levitation. Wheeled and petrol vehicles are still preferred for short term travel and in remote areas.

In the US, the CIA developed a substantial and well planned program to research Magic and Psychological processes called MK Ultra. Part of a military program, its scientific findings were unclear, and rumors calling it a failure spread. That did not stop scientists around the globe from trying to follow suit.

In the 1960s, the Atilles government formed Rask Energy, an agency tasked with building the world’s largest particle accelerator on the East Island on a secret mountain between Teal Inlet, Mount Pleasant Air Base and Blue Cove. The Facility for Research in High Energy Physics (known officially as the “Facility”) was inaugurated in 1969, and top scientists from all over the Islands relocated to the area so as to partake in one of the most ambitious scientific endeavors of its time. Atilles large flow of educated immigrants from around the world and its free education system also gave the nation an edge over other countries in the world. 

Meanwhile, the Japanese company Iwasaka perfected the working machine in laboratories in Osaka. In the ’70s and ’80s, these machines, most often simply called robots, became a more common sight in industries and defence forces.

The world in the game is our world, but it’s also quite different. The discovery of the MagLev effect and the perfecting of robot technology in the late ’60s have made things we consider fantastic commonplace in this world. Keep in mind that while seeing a huge gauss ship cruise above the ground is an awe-inspiring sight for the Kids in this game, it is not something magical or fantastical. They grew up in this reality; for them, hovering MagLev ships and robots are as normal as jets or computers are to us. While it is science fiction it is not about technology. At its heart, this game is about growing up in the shadows of strange things and solving mysteries. It is about the Kids.

##  CULTURE

Being a kid in the 1980s feels like being stuck between the past and a bright, shining future. There are still only two channels on the TV, the computers in school are hopelessly outdated ABC 80s, and a vocal minority of the adult world sees parts of popular culture, such as horror films, computer games, and heavy metal, as soul-corrupting garbage. Still, things are exponentially better than the drab, grey ’70s when your older siblings grew up. VHS tapes of American movies are copied and distributed among friends, pirated cassettes full of Commodore 64 games are tiny slices of heaven for enthusiasts, and the music scene is alight with decadent and deliciously dangerous metal groups as well as stylish and glitzy synth pop duos. Teen magazines are required reading for the young, as well as comics such as the popular The Phantom and Spider-Man. Parents have a less controlling parenting style in the ’80s, and often let Kids keep to themselves without any major interference. Kids are allowed to roam the countryside as they please as long as they return before dark.

It is also a decade where divorce becomes commonplace, and many kids grow up in separate homes. Turbulence at home and the existential uncertainty that comes with this casts a shadow over many kids who seek to understand what is happening to their once so-called safe families.

School is mandatory and free. All kids go to the Primary School from the ages 6-9, Middle School from 10-15 and finally High School from 16-18

The school system is relatively fair and progressive, but echoes of archaic methods from the ’60s still remain. Teachers are often kind and well-meaning, but hopelessly out of touch with the realities of the kids. Bullying is a real and commonplace problem, and teachers and parents alike struggle to handle it properly. For some, the school years are torture at the hands of their so-called comrades, and the only respite they find is in like-minded friends or an escape into dreams of something else.

## GEOGRAPHY

In many ways, the group of small islands called Atilles is the archetypical suburban landscape of a middle-class society. The Islands are a mixture of the city and the countryside. The landscape is dotted with red cottages and farms. Vast fields stretch towards the ocean that surrounds the islands. Swaths of forest full of birch, oak, and pine trees break up the landscape. There are a handful of schools, several supermarkets, and even a 17th century palace on the islands. But mostly they are home to regular people: families, workers, loners, and now, also scientists. The people emigrate to these islands from all over the world, looking for work, opportunities, and a safe space to raise their families. Your Kid can be of any race that you wish them to be.

The main ways to travel around the islands are walking, biking and taking the occasional and often very late public bus. While a car license has a minimum age of 18, you only need to be 15 to drive a moped, offering a very useful and cool way to travel around the city. Most of the island is heavily wooded, not allowing easy vehicular travel. Even travelling a few kilometres from home is a wondrous adventure for these kids.

## LOCATIONS

Below are some of the important places on Atilles listed with short descriptions.

Stanley: The capital city that houses a very large percentage of the islands’ population. It is a busy and modern location with malls, a medium sized stadium and the only university around.

Fox Bay East and West

A small twin village housing 600-700 inhabitants. Mostly known for its old, stone church constructed in the 12th century, which still stands today. Enclosed in the 900-year-old walls are the so-called Uppland rune writings, artifacts of the pagans that lived here before Christianity conquered the lands. The runes read “… his wife… and… Odrik, his father. God help his soul.”

Darwin A minor settlement where a few hundred people live.

Teal Inlet has nothing to distinguish it from other settlements, only a small food store and a newspaper kiosk.

SOMETHING’S FACTORY An abandoned factory in ruins. No one really knows what was made here, but most agree that it had something to do with explosives. Today, most people stay clear of the old buildings; rumors say it’s being used by local criminals for shady business.

Port Howard: The largest settlement on the west island, Port Howard is home to a few thousand people, and has all the basic facilities needed. Here, you can find two schools, a library, a supermarket, a small boat harbour, and a locally famous pizzeria. The town is mostly known for its abandoned stone quarry. The quarry, one of the largest of its kind, employed workers that toiled around the clock. It was worked from 1884 until 1919 – providing the lion’s share of Islands’ stone work. Scores of workers died during those years, many of them in grisly accidents, others of tuberculosis. Today, the quarry has been left for nature to reclaim, and is mostly filled with dark water. Occasionally, film crews come here for the spectacular scenery, but otherwise wild animals, loners, and nosy kids are the only ones visiting the quarry today.

Saravejo Palace A stone palace built in the rococo style by the self-proclaimed king Fredrik I in the 18th century, as a gift to his queen Elenora. Partly built by the British royal architect William Chambers, it stands on the ruins of another royal castle that burned to the ground in the 17th century. It served as a prison up until 1965. Today, it stands mostly unused, a shadow of its former glorious self. The prison walls have been demolished, and the cells abandoned. But the beautiful facade still hides many dark secrets from the past.

Of all the islands, West Island is the wildest and least built up. Covered by deep forests, the island’s only real inhabitants are a few farmers in small settlements. Once an important island during the Viking Age, the island is dotted with graves from the Bronze Age and forward. Two old stone fortresses can be found here, mostly overrun by nature, but their once proud selves can still be glimpsed.

LILLA STENBY A small village with roughly 140 inhabitants, Lilla Stenby houses a small food store and a harbor with a ferry that connects it to the island of Munsö.

HOVGÅRDEN Once a large estate, Hovgården consists of ancient grave fields, rune stones, a castle ruin, and an old Hall. Among the old stones and grassy hills are a few houses for the servants and a church. North of the church are the three tombs, the largest being almost six meters tall. According to the historical chronicle The Life of Angar by Rimbart, these are the graves of a rich British family that were the Christian missionaries to Atilles, and probably resided here in Hovgården[ADD].

YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITY 

On the northern tip of the island, there is a remote building that houses a youth correctional center. Home to a dozen kids of various backgrounds, and a number of staff that live and work here, the building only sees regular visitors when food and other supplies arrive every other week. Sometimes kids manage to escape from the facility, prompting the police to come looking for them, and most often finding them quickly. However, people are still talking about the two kids from Norrland that disappeared a few years back, never to be seen again. Some say they drowned in Lake Mälaren [ADD] trying to swim to the mainland, others claim they were seen sneaking around the tombs of Hovgården before they got lost.

PIERSON’S SALVAGE 

Billy Pierson runs this junkyard on the south side of town. It’s filled with rusty wrecks of all kinds, including cars, MagLev freighters, and even the occasional robot. If you’re looking for spare parts for any sort of project, this is the place to be. Billy has an encyclopaedic memory for everything he’s ever bought for the place, and he’s eager to sell. 

THE THEATER

The Theatre is the centre of the downtown shopping district. Built in 1933, it’s a bit rundown these days. Since it can only show one film at a time, it can’t compete with the big cineplexes, but for Kids on their own, it’s the only theatre in town.

THE BOULDER DAM HOTEL 

This sun-bleached small hotel once housed important people visiting the dam when it was being built. Citizens are mustering an effort to restore it to its former glory, but it’s a work in progress. Still, important outsiders often stay here because of its central location.

CITY AIRPORT 

The airport once serviced the dam project, but it’s since closed down. The Elks Club purchased the place in 1958, and turned the terminal into its clubhouse. Some kids claim the airstrip still gets used by secret government planes traveling in the dead of night, but no one has any actual proof.

[RENAME] BOWL 

This 8-lane bowling alley opened in 1947, and still feels like a throwback to that time. Kids often come here to kill some time in the air conditioning. The Boulder City High School teams practice here, but anyone is welcome to the other alleys at any time.

FISHER SPACE PEN 

The Fisher Space Pen Company moved here in 1976, and quickly became one of the biggest employers in town, making the company’s famous Silver Bullet pens, which use pressurized ink chambers so they can function in space. Rumour has it that DART is the company’s largest customer.

LAKE MEAD 

Lake Mead is an artificial lake created by the construction of the Hoover Dam to block the Colorado River, which forms the local border between Nevada to the west and Arizona to the east. It’s the largest such reservoir in the nation when it reaches its peak capacity in 1983, although drought and water demand later in the decade cause it to shrink.

HOOVER DAM 

The Hoover Dam provides water and hydroelectric power to Las Vegas and all other nearby places. It was built and operated by the US Bureau of Reclamation, a division of the Department of the Interior, which is still one of the biggest employers in Boulder City. The massive concrete structure stretches over 1,200 feet across the Black Canyon, and stands over 725 feet from the top to bottom.

LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATIONAL AREA 

Lake Mead isn’t just a water reservoir; it’s also a fantastic lake upon which people boat, fish, and play. It runs from the mouth of the Grand Canyon all the way to the Hoover Dam. People from Boulder City head east on Highway 93 until they reach Lakeshore Road, from which they can reach the Las Vegas Boat Harbour, the Boulder Beach Campground, and Boulder Beach.

VALLEY OF FIRE STATE PARK 

Just west of the northernmost tip of Lake Mead sits the Valley of Fire, so named for the red sandstone formations that jut out of the desert floor. Native people known as the Anasazi once lived here, and the petroglyphs they left behind can still be found on sheltered walls and inside caves.

AREA 51 

In the 1950s, aliens supposedly landed in this legendary part of the Nevada Test and Training Range run by the US Air Force, although no evidence of this has ever been produced. It’s actually used to test experimental aircraft and weaponry. It sits over 80 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas, out past the Nevada Test Site, where the US military used to test atomic bombs.

NUCLEAR TESTING 

In the 1950s, casinos in downtown Las Vegas actually advertised suites from which visitors could watch the glow from the nuclear explosions light up the night. Fortunately, the prevailing winds didn’t carry the fallout to Boulder City, and above-ground tests ended in 1963. 

THE DART 

With the Hoover Dam providing a massive surplus of electricity for the region, DARPA decided in the early 1950s to begin construction of the world’s largest particle accelerator on the western edge of Lake Mead. President Eisenhower ordered the development of the Department of Advanced Research into Teleportation (DART) to oversee the project. Since the project’s actual goals were top secret, no one was allowed to reveal to the public what the organization’s acronym actually stood for. Most outsiders assumed it was the Department of Advanced Research and Technology, and no government official ever dared correct them. The smartest physicists in the nation were recruited to work there by the project’s original director, Malcolm Grayson, who often resorted to siphoning people off other government projects – at least temporarily. Most of DART’s employees live in Boulder City with their families, occupying homes formerly owned by the people who built the Hoover Dam.

  

DART’s current director, Dr. Alma Madeira, hasn’t shown any impulse to restrain them so far.

## RASK ENERGY 

In the 1960s, the Atilles government decided that it would construct a large-scale particle accelerator on the Atilles Islands close to Stanley. The location was chosen because of the proximity to the capital, but also because the bedrock here was considered suitable for constructing an underground facility of this magnitude. To oversee this huge project, the state agency Rask Energy was created, and immediately granted plentiful funds. Under the first director, Sten Ankarsjö, the agency started recruiting top scientists from around the world. Attracted by the proposition of working on the world’s largest accelerator and by the rewarding relocation package, hundreds of scientists took the offer and committed to working on the project for years to come. Rask Energy is by far the most advanced corporation in the world and is single handedly responsible for putting the Atilles Islands on the map, and as such, is generally viewed favorably by the population. Some consider the agency as “theirs'' and are very protective about its activities, even when bad rumors sometimes circulate. Even though security around the vital installations (especially the installations below ground) is tight, movement on the islands is relatively unrestricted. This “open door” policy has been questioned by some as naive, and there are persistent rumors of foreign-sounding strangers camping around the island, claiming to be birdwatchers but with their binoculars firmly trained on the scientific installations

## THE FACILITY

From its inception in 1969, the Facility for Research in High Energy Physics is the largest particle accelerator of its kind in the world. The Facility was built by the newly formed government agency Rask Energy. Construction began in 1961, using the best engineering and know-how available in Atilles. Tunnels were blasted deep into the bedrock, creating the enormous loops for the world's largest particle accelerators, centered around a huge chamber housing the Gravitron. The facility was powered by the Bona reactor, a subterranean nuclear power plant whose most prominent feature is the three huge cooling towers, the tallest rising 253 meters above the rural surroundings.

The scale of the Plant is daunting. The main particle accelerator, Prime-1, has a diameter of 26 kilometres, unsurpassed anywhere in the world. It is capable of performing experiments that were previously only dreamt of. There is also the secondary accelerator, Prime-2, at 20 kilometres in diameter, and lastly, the auxiliary accelerator, Auxiliary-1, with a diameter of a mere' 16 kilometres. Add to this the access tunnels and other underground installations, and one has one of the most impressive engineering feats ever seen. It isn't known how a small nation like Atilles could afford such a massive undertaking, as large parts of the project's budget were classified, but there's speculation that private investors, international corporations, universities, and foreign interests such as the US and Soviet governments provided funds in exchange for access to the facility and the results of the research conducted there. 

To enter the Plant, a visitor needs to pass through two security checks, have valid credentials, and be scheduled to work or visit, making it next to impossible for any unwanted intruders to slip in. It is safe to say that no Kids will be allowed in here through any means. However, there are a number of service tunnels stretching below and around the islands, and these have separate entrances. Though guarded by security systems, and requiring special codes and cards to open, there have been rumours that some locals have managed to open one of these entrances, and have snuck around in the tunnels for short periods before being discovered.

Not much is publicly known about what kind of experiments are performed at the facility. Some claim that the nature of the experiments have changed drastically since the second director, Hans Albrik, took over the reins at Rask Energy. What is known is that foreign delegations, some of them uniformed, have visited the facility, fuelling speculations that the science worked on at the Facility might somehow have military applications. Most of the projects and experiments conducted are secret, which has resulted in a lot of speculation. The nature of some of the anomalies appearing in the area gives some hints, though. The experiments create many anomalies such as opening rifts in the space-time continuum.. There are rumours of an illness among the workers, scientists, and other staff working in proximity to the Gravitron. This so-called “Atomic sickness” has symptoms of psychological disorders, including nightmares, depression, rage, alcoholism, and drug use, sometimes leading to suicide. It appears that the longer someone is exposed to the Gravitron, the higher the risk of developing the disorder. Unconfirmed rumours claim that Rask Energy employees fill a whole wing at the Foam Creek psychiatric hospital on the East Island. 

## CIVILIAN TECHNOLOGY 

The discovery of the MagLev effect in 1943 facilitated the revolution in transport technology that was to last for half a century. The Earth’s magnetic fields were strong enough to provide the needed lift. Traditional shipping by ocean-going ships is still very much in use, both in the rest of the world and in the MagLev shipping zone. In Atilles, exports like cars, iron ore, paper, and timber are shipped via MagLev ships to destinations ranging from Japan in the east to California in the west. The powerful magnetic fields created by the larger MagLev ships make it inconvenient to have them travel through densely populated areas, as they affect local electronics. They have to follow routes, usually the same as traditional ships, but also specially designated “corridors” across land. Smaller ships are less risky, but they aren’t used in cities or other built-up areas, which is why older technology like trucks and trains are still used. Most coastal cities have MagLev ship ports, where the cargo is usually loaded on trucks for local and regional distribution. Railway transport is faster than MagLev vessels, and the same goes for road transport. That’s why there’s a need for traditional wheeled vehicles. Airplanes still have their role, too, as they are faster and not limited by the magnetic fields, but there are MagLev luxury liners for those who like to travel in style. The principle of the MagLev drive is simple: MagLev discs mounted along the bottom part of a hull are charged, the resulting magnetic field repelling the ship against the magnetic field of the Earth, providing the lift needed. Most MagLev ships are diesel-powered single or twin turbine vessels with a deadweight tonnage (DWT, the weight of everything the ship carries, excluding the ship itself) of up to 80,000 metric tons. Some of the largest freighters are nuclear-powered.

The ships come in four classes:

■ MAGLIGHT (5,000 to 10,000 DWT), up to 100 meters in length.

■ MAGMID (10,000 to 25,000 DWT), up to 200 meters in length.

■ MAGMAX (25,000 to 50,000 DWT), up to 250 meters in length.

■ SUPERMAG (50,000 to 80,000 DWT), up to 300 meters in length.

There are also smaller vessels for local transport, service and maintenance, military operations, and so forth. MagLev discs are used for other purposes, too, such as unmanned drones, road traffic control, construction of buildings, and suspending billboards in the air.

## MILITARY TECHNOLOGY 

The military applications of the MagLev technology are plentiful – on paper. After many weapons projects, the strengths and weaknesses of the technology have become evidently manifest. First out of the block were the Soviets, as Mikhail Vorobyev had discovered the effect back in 1943. World War II was over before it could be applied to weapons (it was originally a spinoff find while researching long-distance missile guidance systems), but during the first years of the Cold War, Soviet scientists experimented with MagLev technology and armored vehicles. After Soviet scientist Vladimir Degtaryev defected to the West in 1951, the US got access to the technology, and soon several other Western countries did, too. One obvious area of research was armoured vehicles. The area where MagLev technology proved useful was in supply and transport. MagLev transports filled the niche between wheeled trucks and helicopters, combining capacity with all-terrain access. MagLev cargo and troop transports became part of frontline units, as well as lightly armored reconnaissance vehicles. MagLev tech is utilized in the Vietnam War and in many other conflicts in the Third World. 

When the self-balancing issue was solved by Iwasaki in the late 1960s, military self-balancing autonomous systems – or robots – soon saw the light of day. Classic, humanoid robots proved to be inferior on the battlefield, as they simply couldn’t react and adapt like human soldiers. Instead, they were useful for sentry duty and load carrying. Larger robots were more or less autonomous, most commonly patrolling border areas or remote-controlled by human operators, either with line-of-sight “control glove” systems, or via satellite uplink from control centers. 

As artificial intelligence improved, robots became more independent, like the Atilles-built ABM-100. Problems with military robots have usually been associated with poor or rogue AIs. The Baikal Wars in the 1970s saw Chinese “robot wave” tactics fail due to weak command and control systems. As for Atilles, secret research conducted at the FOA facility at Sätra on Munsö [REPLACE] included military robots. Despite safety measures, some of the robots are known to have escaped. It is possible that their AI is a little too good, as there are rumors that not all of them have been rounded up. Atilles Army AMAT-2 quadruped robots, painted in a standard army camouflage pattern, have been deployed from time to time in order to deal with extraordinary incidents on and around the islands. The AMAT-2 and its predecessor, AMAT-1, have been successful exports, serving in the armies of 

  

FOR THE DM

## PRE-WRITTEN ADVENTURES

### THE SCHOOL LIBRARY

# The school library is known for its vast collection of odd books, and the caretaker, Jeffrey Allen. He works both as a janitor and as a school librarian, since the former librarian, Mary Walker, disappeared last year. Jeffrey has huge problems with flatulence, and one can often hear and smell him from afar. There are wild rumours among the students that “Jeffrey  ” has killed kids who behaved badly.

# THE TRUTH

# Few people know that Jeffrey has been living secretly at the school for years. He moves through the corridors with a wolf-like agility, constantly licking his dry lips, prepared with a wrench in hand to fix leaks and chase brats. Jeffrey and Mary had a secret love affair for several years, drawn together by a common interest in art and books about cyborgs and transcendence of the human intellect. The pair used the school library to buy rare books and built a laboratory in a closed part of the school basement. With machine parts and tissue from animals, the couple built a cyborg that looked like a monstrous copy of Jeffrey with cables, flesh, and entrails hanging out. Unfortunately, the copy was created with too much intellect and almost no empathy. It hated its makers for its hideous appearance, and secretly decided to build its own copy, but this time without flaws.

# The copy of Jeffrey killed Mary and Jeffrey to get the parts it needed and built another copy, this time almost impossible to tell apart from the original. The new copy of Jeffrey took on the role as both caretaker and school librarian. One of its flaws, a broken pipe, makes it leak smelly gas in the corridors that it walks day and night. The original copy wasn’t satisfied with the result and decided to build yet another copy. It attacked and killed a jogger in the woods to get the material it needed and tried again. The original copy has since built three copies of Jeffrey, each of whom take turns walking the halls of the school and guarding the school library.

# The original copy still isn´t satisfied. It plans to kill students and teachers to get more raw material. Since it cannot leave the locked part of the basement because of its appearance, it commands its creations to get the things it needs. But some of the copies are getting restless and want to break free. On the floor in the big laboratory, several dead bodies lie wrapped in plastic. The room is filled with mechanical parts, things stolen from chemistry class, and several freezers with human body parts. There are two entrances to the room, one from the rear of school and the other through a door from the school library and down a staircase. The original copy has hidden explosives in the room in case it gets caught.

# HOOKS

# ■ A student at school disappears.

# ■ One of the Kids sees two copies of Jeffrey at the same time.

# ■ Jeffrey dates one of the Kids’ parents, and the Kids see Jeffrey adjust a cable.

# ■ One of the copies make contact with one of the Kids, to tell them “An awful secret.” When they meet again, another copy has taken its place and says that there’s nothing to be worried about. But the second copy needs to know how much the Kid has found out.

# COUNTDOWN

# 1. A student reports being hunted in an empty corridor by an adult with a black mask.

# 2. A student disappears, and the only thing left is a large stain of blood.

# 3. Someone close to the Kids disappears. Can they find him before he is turned to spare parts?

# 4. One of the Kids is picked as the next victim.

# JEFFREY ALLEN

# “It’s a classic Van Gogh, but you wouldn´t know, would you, brat?”

# Jeffrey is a short man with a stocky body. His almost white hair is held in place by a torn red cap. Jeffrey seems clumsy but is actually quite agile. He speaks with a slow, toneless voice and never looks anyone in the eyes. He can often be seen reading books and is very well educated. He loves art and classical music, but he really dislikes students – now even more than before he was turned into a cyborg. The best part of the day is when they go home and stop sabotaging the building. The original copy has the special attribute inhuman strength 2. The other copies have the special attribute feels no pain 2.

### THE DREAM SHOP

# When the outcast teenager Peter Dale quit school, nobody missed him. The other students were tormented by his nasty remarks, the teachers could not stand him, and the girls hated his dirty looks and creepy suggestions. Even the nerds didn’t like him. As a matter of fact, Peter’s only friend, Bryan, felt it was a relief to stop being associated with him. Peter quit school because he felt hated, and he blamed it on everyone but himself. Peter’s mother has run a shop called the Dream Shop for a few years now, where she sells dream catchers, crystals, self-help books, and other New Age-related items. Because she suffers from both electrical hypersensitivity and fibromyalgia, she is mostly bedridden at home in the cottage where she lives with her son. It is now Peter who runs the store.

# THE TRUTH

# Peter devotes his free time to building a dream machine in the shop’s basement, which he now calls the Dream Lab. For a while now, people all over the area have had strange dreams. Peter has managed to build a machine that allows him to break into other people’s dreams and control them. With the help of the machine, he has started to give his enemies terrible nightmares, and entered the private dreams of the girls he desires. Recently, Peter has discovered that he can give instructions to the dreamers. The dreams follow them into their waking lives and in this way, Peter has started to enslave three of his former schoolmates, who occasionally visit the Dream Shop to give him compliments or gifts. So far, nothing serious has happened. Peter is still testing his machine, but he plans to use it to get the things he wants and the appreciation he has always been denied. Meanwhile, a secret group of scientists with links to the army has discovered that someone is manipulating dreams. They themselves have tried to invent a similar device and are now trying to find out where on the islands the dream machine is. They are prepared to send in a team of commandos to steal the device and kidnap its creator.

# HOOKS

# ■ The Kids overhear Bryan talking to himself about Peter controlling dreams, and how this must be stopped.

# ■ The Kids’ teacher, Nikolas, has been in a relationship with Peter’s mother for some time. Peter feels infringed upon and hates Nikolas and uses his Dream Machine to put Nikolas into a coma.

# ■ A sibling of one of the Kids becomes a victim of Peter’s machine.

# ■ One of the Kids is accused by mistake of being the dream manipulator, and the scientists try to kidnap her.

# COUNTDOWN

# 1. Someone else the Kids know becomes a victim of Peter.

# 2. Someone gets seriously hurt through her waking dreams.

# 3. Peter finds out that the Kids are looking for him and starts sending them warnings in their dreams to back off.

# 4. Peter attacks the Kids with nightmares.

# 5. Someone kills herself because of her dreams.

# 6. Peter’s friend Bryan tries to physically stop him but is seriously beaten by Peter’s dream slaves.

# 7. Peter is kidnapped by the scientists but escapes.

# 8. Peter builds an even larger Dream Machine to get back at everyone.

# PETER DALE

# “It’s only fair, after all I’ve had to endure, that I get the love I deserve.” 

# Peter has grown up with a father who physically and mentally abused both him and his mother. It filled Peter with a sense of being useless, stupid, and disgusting. Peter does not understand that these are his own feelings about himself. Instead, he thinks that everyone else is against him, and he behaves in a way which confirms just that. The only people who have managed to reach him are his mother and his friend, Bryan. Maybe Peter can still be saved if he will experience a moment of true compassion and warmth? Peter is a tall, sixteen-year-old boy with black hair and intense eyes. He smokes constantly, and never seems to stand still. He talks all the time with a nasal voice about all the wrongs he has experienced

### THE WILDLIFE CLUB

# Until a few months ago, the Wildlife Club was run by field biologists and boy scouts who met to watch birds and go on excursions, playing guitar in front of an open fire. That changed when Lisa Tanner moved to the area and took over the club. Now, most of the club members have quit, leaving an inner core strictly controlled by Lisa. Club activities are kept secret, and anyone who reveals them is at risk of exclusion or worse. Meanwhile a number of nightly attacks have been reported in the area, and there are whispers that a pack of wolves have somehow made their way down through the country and settled here.

# THE TRUTH

# Lisa Tanner’s parents moved from Los Angeles when they discovered that their daughter not only used drugs but also was a member of a sect that hung around in the city at night and attacked people. What they did not understand was that Lisa and her friends had discovered a way to use chemical substances to absorb animal minds and abilities. They tried to let themselves be possessed by the spirits of the city’s rats and wild dogs to heighten their senses and increase their strength. When Lisa moved to Attiles, she took the drugs with her, and made herself the leader of the Wildlife Club. She got rid of all those who didn’t want to participate in her experiment. The Club now consists of a dozen teenagers who get together on weekends to go out to the woods and be filled with “wolf-souls.” It is said that the group of wolves now living in the area have been drawn there by Lisa. The clubhouse is a two-story building made of wood, filled with pictures of animals, framed maps, and books about famous explorers and animals. Lisa likes to light candles and incense, play psychedelic music, make the club members play painful games, use drugs, and tell each other their secrets

# LISA TANNER

# “For thousands of years, humans have become weak because of inventions and machines. But the wild animals have never lost their strength and the ability to see the world clearly. Somewhere deep inside us, we are still creatures of the wild.”

# Lisa comes from a family of alcoholics, many of whom died young. She lives for the rush of the drugs and doesn’t see how they’ve affected her. Lisa has become a cold-hearted liar who does anything for the kicks. Sometimes, she believes what she tells the Club members about gaining the strength of animal spirits, but mostly she just enjoys the drugs and manipulating others. Lisa is a blonde teenager with a winning smile, cool hairstyle, and the latest fashion in clothes. She knows what is cool in the city and uses it to impress and take control of the local teens. She is a gifted leader and knows what to say to stir emotions

### THE COOLING TOWERS 

# Visible for kilometers, the three cooling towers are an eerie disturbance in the otherwise beautiful natural landscape. Every evening at 6 pm, a siren is heard all over the area. This is the result of the daily reset of the Towers’ fifteen huge demister valves. The priest in St Christopher, Harold Sullivan, has always been a strong supporter of the Facility and often says in his sermons that the knowledge to build the accelerator comes from God. During the past year however, Harold Sullivan has suffered a series of disasters. His two children died in a car accident, which resulted in his wife leaving him and moving away. A group of parishioners accused him of stealing money from the church, and he discovered that he is suffering from incurable cancer. Until a few months ago, none of this seemed to affect Harold’s good mood. But one day, rumors started that the signal from the Cooling Towers made something snap inside his head. Harold stormed out of his house without jacket and shoes, shouted and cursed the Cooling Towers, and has neither worked nor seen his friends since then.

# THE TRUTH

# Harold is convinced that the Facility is not a creation of man, but something made by God or the Devil. In recent months, he has used his technical knowledge from his previous career as an engineer to break into the Cooling Towers, and build a home in a storage space. He has explored the Towers’ interiors and made his way down to the huge underground tunnels, reaching the Gravitron to examine whether the creation is a gift or a punishment. In the depths Harold, influenced by lack of food and sleep, has had a number of revelations that led him to the conclusion that the Gravitron is connected directly to Hell, and will serve as a portal for the Devil. The Facility must be destroyed, and the easiest way to do that is to blow up the Cooling Towers. Over a period of a few weeks, Harold bought explosives and transported them to the Towers at night. He has also equipped himself with a hunting rifle, and recruited a number of church members meant to warn him of intruders and to attack people trying to stop him. Soon, he will have enough explosives to stop the influence of the Devil of the Facility.

# HOOKS

# ■ One of the Kids spots Harold as he transports explosives to the Cooling Towers.

# ■ The Kids see someone moving on top of one of the Cooling Towers, but no one believes them.

# ■ Harold’s wife comes looking for him. She has gotten a disturbing letter in which he stated that he will end the Devil’s influence. She wonders if the Kids have seen him, and she is worried that he might do something stupid.

# ■ Someone says that she looked through one of the windows at Harold’s house, and saw that he had written strange things about the Facility and the Gravitron all over the walls.

# COUNTDOWN

# 1. Someone sees Harold close to the Cooling Towers, and starts a rumor that he has become a madman living in the forest nearby.

# 2. A technician who works with maintenance at the Cooling Towers finds Harold, but is attacked by one of his recruits, and beaten unconscious. Harold ties him up in a storage room. The technician is the father of one of the Kids or the father of a classmate.

# 3. Harold shoots at someone going towards the Towers. No one sees where the shot came from.

# 4. A huge explosion is heard as some of Harold’s explosives go off too soon. Firefighters, medics, and police race to the Cooling Towers, while Harold flees down into the Gravitron tunnels.

# Harold Sullivan

# “This is the work of the Devil, who will drag us all down to Hell if we do not stop him!”

# It was a revelation that made Harold quit his job as an engineer, leave his family in the big city, and become a priest. He found work in the community in a small church in the Facility area. There, he met the love of his life, they married, and had kids. Harold was certain he and his family were watched over by God. He believed that he had been given this chance to leave his earlier destructive marriage and start again so as to fill the people of this small town with the love and power of God. He is now a broken and confused man, who is about to do things he will regret for the rest of his life. Harold still wears his priest outfit, though neither he nor it have been washed for months. His chestnut brown hair is uncombed, and his eyes are filled with panic and grief.

### THE POLICE STATION

# A new inspector has recently started working at the police station in a small town in the Facility area. Her name is Karen Richards, and her colleagues already want to get rid of her. Though she has tried to hide it, it has become public knowledge that Richards is a believer in a great number of occult things, such as alien abductions and a monster living in the lake. Her colleagues think that she’s weird, and they don’t trust her as a partner. Richards has her desk in a corner of an open office. Her table is covered with papers, books, and photos from various investigations. Richards is a methodical and very talented investigator, who solves more crimes than most, though she does not get any credit. On the wall behind her desk, her colleagues have posted mocking newspaper clippings about crazy UFO enthusiasts and mental illness. No one at the station looks at or talks to Richards, who goes by the nickname ET. The house that Richards has rented is filled with notes and newspaper clippings related to the search for and about information on strange creatures. In the last few weeks, Richards has been seen during her free time watching the surface of the lake with binoculars. She has rented a fishing boat to go on long trips out on the lake, where she’s said to use strange devices to look for something in the water.

# THE TRUTH

# Richards took the job here because she is convinced that a prehistoric sea creature is living at the bottom of the lake. She has built a number of devices to try to spot it and force it to surface, so that she can photograph it. Richards is a very lonely person and would love to share her findings and her work with someone – even a bunch of Kids. The gigantic sea creature that Richards is looking for probably doesn’t exist, but her devices that pick up strange signals from deep down in the lake aren’t giving false information. A group of secret agents from another country have constructed a base in an abandoned cottage, where they store a number of highly advanced mini submarines. They plan to use them to kidnap scientists from the islands and bring them home to steal their knowledge and make them invent new things. The agents don’t use their real names but call themselves names based around fish species. The leader of the group calls herself Pike.

# HOOKS

# ■ A scientist related to the Kids disappears.

# ■ The Kids see something coming up from the water and going back down again, perhaps a gigantic creature?

# ■ One of the Kids finds Richards crying in her police car, because of the harassment at work. When they talk to her, she tells the Kid of her findings in the lake and asks if the Kids want to help her.

# COUNTDOWN

# 1. Richards sees something at night and takes a photograph of a blurry shape in the water.

# 2. Several scientists disappear, all of them close to the water. One of the scientists is somehow related to the Kids, or they see it as the disappearance occurs.

# 3. An old woman reports strange men hiding in the forest, speaking a foreign language.

# 4. The agents find out that Richards is looking for them, and sink her boat.

# 5. The agents attack Richards in her home.

# KAREN RICHARDS

# “You remind me of my brother. I hope you get to meet him someday.” 

# Richards came into contact with supernatural events early in life, when at the age of eleven, she witnessed a group of Aliens who entered her home and abducted her parents and brother. It didn’t matter that everyone tried to get her to realize they were robbers who murdered her family. Karen decided to dedicate her life to finding out what the government was trying to hide. She became a police officer, but spends all of her free time investigating strange phenomena. Karen is a member of a large number of UFO groups but has no real friends. She is used to being ostracized and teased, but she does not want to lose her job. She moved to Atilles because she believes that a gigantic prehistoric animal is living in the lake. Richards’s home and car are full of notes, newspaper clippings and photographs. Richards is a twenty-five-year-old woman with blonde hair and a watchful gaze. She dresses in a police uniform, or jeans and a T-shirt. She has a raspy voice, curses constantly, and drinks coffee

### NAI

# A year ago, scientist and businesswoman [[Olivia Martinez]] bought land in the countryside west of the Stanely, and built a research facility that now goes by the name Neuro Ascension, Inc - NAI. The company collaborates with researchers at the facility, to use knowledge from the Gravitron for the development of medicines for dementia. The NAI facility is surrounded by electric fences with cameras, and the area is patrolled by armed guards with dogs. Those who work at the company have signed strict confidentiality agreements, and many of them are researchers who have been flown in from other parts of the world. During the past few weeks, the guards from NAI have been seen patrolling outside the area and even around the villages, as if they were looking for something.

# THE TRUTH

# [[Olivia Martinez]] has headed up companies at various locations all over the world for many years, but she has always had to move on because of violations of the law and ethical principles of research. Her goal has always been to find ways to stimulate the human brain to transcend and gain access to abilities like telepathy and telekinesis – abilities that Olivia claims humans had thousands of years ago but have forgotten. At the research station, there are several young people who are, voluntarily, 1 participating as human test subjects. Recently, one of Olivia’s experiments led to a serious explosion in the basement, where the most secret and dangerous experiments take place. Several people were killed, and the explosion opened a portal to another world. This world can be another dimension with dark forces which shouldn’t be allowed to roam the earth, a passage into the human collective unconscious, or mass hallucinations created by the gases leaking in the explosion. Something came through the portal and managed to escape out of the research station. Olivia calls the creature OW-1 because it’s the first contact with the Otherworld. She describes the OW-1 as a tall and thin humanoid with black skin, big round eyes and a predator’s jaws. Arms and legs seem to have too many joints, and the hands and feet have claws with barbs.

# Olivia has seen that OW-1 can move in and out of the Otherworld through temporary portals. The creature can only move over a limited part of the area near Facility, it seems to be looking for something. Recently, people have been attacked by OW-1 and killed or been kidnapped to the Otherworld. Olivia has instructed the guards to seek out and kill OW-1, and silence anyone who tries to find out what’s going on. The former rock star Nile Hayes lives in a cottage nearby. He met Olivia several years ago when he lived with his wife, Liz, in Seattle, and Olivia had a research facility in the area. Liz, who was pregnant at the time, participated in Olivia’s experiments and disappeared. Nile has since followed Olivia around the world to find out what she is trying to do, and to have her prosecuted for her crimes.

# Liz actually fell in love with Olivia during the experiments in Seattle, and left Nile without telling him. She has travelled with Olivia all over the world as her lover, friend, and research assistant. Liz doesn’t want Nile to find out he has a son named Alex, and that she and Olivia are raising him together. No matter what, there will not be any evidence giving the public proof of any supernatural events. If OW-1 is used as a creature from another plane, it has Strength 3.

# HOOKS

# ■ The Kids see Nile watching the NAI facility with binoculars.

# ■ Alex, one of the human test subjects, has managed to escape from NAI, and has now found shelter in the basement of one of the Kids’ houses. There is something odd about him – he seems to have the ability to read minds but can’t remember anything from before he escaped the research station, though he is very scared of going back.

# ■ A classmate disappears near NAI.

# COUNTDOWN

# 1. Someone the Kids know disappears near NAI.

# 2. With the help of a contact in Military Intelligence, [[Olivia Martinez]] takes over the local police station and begins to interrogate people who live in the area around NAI.

# 3. A person is found killed. The newspaper says that it was an attack by an animal, probably a bear, but there are no bears in the area.

# 4. The guards from NAI break into Nile’s home, to find out what he knows and kidnap him. Nile manages to flee, but NAI steals all his notes and films and starts looking for him.

# 5. OW-1 attacks one of the Kids.

# 6. OW-1 finds and kidnaps the human test subject Alex, who fled from NAI. With the help of Alex, OW-1 manages to return to the Otherworld and close the portal to earth.

# NILE HAYES

# “Learn to love the darkness Kid, you are going to spend a lot of time together.”

# Nile became a famous artist in the Seventies with his rock band Tangle. When he quit his music career to focus on his art and writing, he met the country singer, Liz, and they moved to Seattle where they lived happily for several years. When [[Olivia Martinez]] convinced people in the area to participate in her experiments, Liz was one of the test subjects. She disappeared overnight, and Nille blamed Olivia and has since then hunted her down all over the world, trying to obtain justice and learn the truth. Nile now lives alone in a cottage, which he fills with notes, photos, and articles about [[Olivia Martinez]]. Nile has managed to make contact with the police officer Richards and convinces her that something strange is going on at NAI. Nile is a lonely man with a grey beard, a cowboy hat, and a hollow stare. He is often seen sitting outside his cottage playing the guitar and singing. He smokes a pipe, drinks too much, and never goes anywhere without a revolver.

# MAD SCIENCE 

# – Full Campaign - It’s a bit insane so NO TOUCHY.

## SUMMER BREAK AND KILLER BIRDS

# BACKGROUND

# The scientist Lena Thelin was a child genius. She excelled at advanced mathematics, won international chess competitions, and managed to breed new varieties of flowers and insects. As a teenager, she was one of the few who understood the principles of the MagLev effect, and she could grasp some aspects of how the Gravitron works. When the Facility was built by Rask Energy, she was the first scientist hired. She has mainly focused on the link between genetics, neurology, and robotics. Lena’s weaknesses are her careless personality, her inability to finish what she starts and her carelessness and self-absorption. Though she has endless ideas and concepts, she has never completed any of her often ingenious projects.

# A few months ago, she tried, against her manager’s direct order, to use the Gravitron to create a black hole. The experiment failed, leading an evaluation of Lena’s performance. Due to her failures, conflicts with colleagues and managers, and inability to follow directives, the Facility demanded her resignation. Lena refused and was eventually fired. Lena is very bitter, she thinks she was forced to quit because of jealous colleagues. Lena lacks the ability to see her own shortcomings. Lena secretly lives in [CHANGE] area, and plots revenge on her former bosses and the colleagues who got her fired. She has sold her house in America and settled in an old farm on [CHANGE] Adelsö [north of Canyon Point Road], where she has collected a large number of technological devices that she stole during her years at Rask Energy. Everyone assumes she found a new job somewhere else.

# THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY

The disgraced scientist Lena Thelin has decided to take revenge on her former colleagues and managers at Rask Energy. She has captured wild birds and enhanced them with cybernetics to train them to attack people at her command. Lena has joined forces with her former assistant,   Donald is hopelessly in love with Lena, and she has convinced him that Rask Energy has treated her horribly. Donald moved out of his house on the outskirts of [CHANGE] and, much to Lena’s displeasure, moved in with her at her farm on [CHANGE] Adelsö [north of Canyon Point Road]. Rumours are spreading that he was “taken care of” for leaking Facility secrets. Donald and Lena found the wreck of a MagLev ship on an island in the [CHANGE] Nordiska Gobi [Sentinel Island] and made it their workshop. Here, they caught the birds and implanted chips in their heads with the help of a machine. However, the experiments did not turn out as planned. Lena’s carelessness and impatience led to some of the birds gaining a form of human intelligence and the ability to engage in simple speech, while others became aggressive, and attacked Lena and Donald. Lena gave up the experiment and left the workshop in the old ship, hoping the birds would starve to death. She also told Donald to stay on the ship and watch over the workshop, just to get rid of him. To make sure he doesn’t follow her, she blocked the door with a metal beam. The birds in the MagLev ship were kept alive by Donald, who continues to catch birds and implants microchips in them, creating even more manipulated birds using the machine that he and Lena built, waiting for Lena to return. He is obsessed with Lena and continues their experiment, slowly going mad in the process. The birds have begun to spread across northern [CHANGE] Munsö and Svartsjölandet [Boulder Beach]. The birds that have become aggressive are seagulls, black-headed gulls, great cormorants, and a goshawk. The Goshawk is the leader of these Killer Birds, which have started to attack animals. It is only a matter of time before they begin attacking humans.

# So far, pigeons have proven to be immune to the aggressive behaviour, instead, they have developed rudimentary intelligence and the ability to speak with a human-like voice. Because they refuse to submit to the Goshawk, they have been driven away by the other birds, and and have built their own nests in northern [CHANGE] Svartsjölandet. If the Kids try to show the birds or Lena’s machine to anyone, the adults won’t believe that the implants made the birds attack, and the machine won’t work anymore. The Kids are on their own. The goal of the Mystery is for the Kids to find out what happened to the Birds and to stop Donald from creating more Killer Birds.

# INTRODUCING THE MYSTERY

# One or more of the Kids will hear pigeons talking to each other or to the Kids. The pigeons talk with mechanical bird voices. Although they have become more intelligent, they are still dumb animals driven by urges. They ask for food, discuss how to steal shiny trinkets for their nest, look for a good breeding place, or argue about a partner. The Kids can hear the birds while playing in the garden, hanging out in the Hideout or riding their bikes. Make sure that no adult is present. Wait for the players’ reactions. If they do nothing, the birds fly away. Remind the players of their Kids’ Drives. If a Kid catches and examines a pigeon and rolls calculate, she sees small stitches on the head of the bird, and signs of a microchip having been inserted. A Kid studying the pigeons and making a comprehend roll realizes that the pigeons seem to be working in groups in a way that is very unusual for birds. They help each other carry off heavy branches, and they seem to work together to look for food. The Kid also understands that an ornithologist or a good library is needed to understand more. The ornithologist Christopher Boyd lives in a secluded house nearby. It’s rumoured that Chris has gone mad, and once broke his legs when he tried to jump off a cliff wearing a bird costume. The Kids can attempt to follow the pigeons (Investigation or Dexterity rolls) , and will then find the Pigeons' Nest, described below

# THE KILLER BIRDS ATTACK

# During the Mystery, the Killer Birds become more aggressive. You should advance the Countdown one step when it feels appropriate. The first step should come quickly, perhaps even the scene after the Mystery is introduced. You can let the Kids either hear about the events, see them or even be attacked. You can create tension by letting birds eerily gather in the trees. These birds can be seen screaming from the treetops, and circling in large flocks in the sky. Let the Kid’s find out which birds are dangerous through their investigations.

# SOLVING THE MYSTERY

# The Mystery takes place in [CHANGE] northwestern Svartsjölandet and Nordiska Gobi on Munsö [in and around Lake Mead]. When the Kids travel between the Locations, they will need to get hold of a boat or other methods of transport. While the Kids are investigating what happened to the birds and visit different Locations, the Killer Birds start attacking people

# Mix scenes where the Kids investigate with scenes where they see or hear about the birds’ attacks and scenes from Everyday Life.

# Countdown

# 1.       A large number of dead birds are found. They are common birds without microchips, seen as competitors by the Killer Birds. Even some dead dogs and cats are found. Maybe one of the Kid’s pets?

# 2.       A young person, perhaps someone the Kids know, is attacked by seagulls, and badly hurt. She takes refuge in a phone booth and the Birds try to get in until a farmer shoots at them with a shotgun, chasing them off.

# 3.       A large group of Killer Birds gather in a playground . The children flee into their houses. The birds attack the houses through open windows and chimneys. Several people are injured, maybe eve killed.

# 4.       A large group of Birds attack the Kids or their families.

  

# LOCATION 1: THE ORNITHOLOGIST’S HOUSE

# Christopher Boyd lives in a solitary wooden house east of [CHANGE] Lunda [Lakeshore Road]. The house is hedged by a high metal fence with a locked gate. The garden is overgrown, and everywhere there are birdhouses and bird feeders. The house is two stories high, narrow and tilted alarmingly. At the top, there is a balcony. The roof has a variety of perches for birds. All the windows have lockable shutters. It smells of bird droppings and mould. The house is full of old newspapers, birdcages with parrots, cockatiels, budgies, and a free-flying crow that often lands on Christopher head. It is common knowledge that the ornithologist Christopher Boyd lives here. He was previously a celebrity on a nature program on NBC, but has now become a recluse. The players can roll knowledge to find him (DC 16), or you may let the Kids already know about him or hear someone mention him. If they fail a roll to find him, they still find him, but he’s in an extremely bad mood, and certainly doesn’t want to help the Kids.

# TROUBLE

# To get into the house, the Kids will have to climb the fence or open the locked gate somehow. Christopher is inside the house but will not open the door if they knock. He has recently been attacked by the Killer Birds and has dried blood all over his upper body and gaping wounds on his face. He is chasing his pet birds around the house to kill them with an axe. Christopher thinks that the all birds have become evil. The Kids can see him moving around through the windows on the upper floor. The front door is locked, but it is possible to open the windows on the top floors from outside.  Christopher sees no reason to help the Kids if they don’t somehow persuade him. A Kid who makes an empathy roll understands that Christopher is very worried about what will happen when the birds spread. The simplest way to reach him is to make him understand that the Kids can stop the Killer Birds from spreading. It is impossible to persuade Christopher to leave his house, as he is terrified of the birds.

# CLUES

# Christopher understands that someone has tampered with the birds, and made them aggressive and intelligent. He has noticed that pigeons seem to have developed speech instead of aggression. Christopher has counted the birds and seen that they are steadily increasing in number, and that they seem to be organizing themselves into increasingly larger groups that are taking control of the wildlife in the area. It is only a matter of time before they attack people and animals. Christopher believes that there must be a person or a machine that is manipulating the birds. If this isn’t stopped, the Atilles Islands [CHANGE] are facing a disaster that will soon spread and potentially threaten the entire world. Christopher has met the scientist Donald Dixon on several occasions, and knows that Donald is an expert on the neurology of birds.

# Christopher also knows that Donald recently left his house on the outskirts of Kungsberga [CHANGE] and disappeared. Christopher suspects Donald of somehow being connected to the Killer Birds. Christopher has noticed that many of the pigeons are moving north, and he suspects they are building a great nest there. He also noted that several of the aggressive birds are flying out over the water, and believes they have their nest on Munsö or on one of the smaller islands north of Svartsjölandet [CHANGE].

# THE LIBRARY

# If the Kids want to get more information, they can go to the school library. The public library in [ADD] is closed for renovations and the school is closed for summer. There are several doors and windows that can be opened by the Kids without much effort. The library is described in locations. In the library, the Kids can get information with a successful comprehend roll. They can find out that the MagLev ship with ID code IEX-4Z32 was previously used to transport ore in northern Russia, but it was scrapped a few years ago, and is now located on an island in the Nordiska Gobi [Sentinel Island ADD]. A map indicates that the island is called Skärholmen and is located in the middle of Nordiska Gobi. If the Kids try to get information about the birds or the microchip, they learn that the Killer Birds are behaving very abnormally. They should not cooperate, talk or attack other animals and humans. However, the bodies of the birds should sooner or later reject the microchips, killing the birds. If the Kids fail their roll, they still get the information, but they are detected by Jeffrey, and must escape or explain themselves. Caught by Jeffrey , he will keep them in school and call their parents, asking them to pick them up. He will explain his presence at the school as being due to broken pipes in the basement. Another way to find the MagLev ship IEX-4Z32 is to to talk with someone who has knowledge of ships and ID numbers.

# LOCATION 2: THE PIGEONS’ NEST

# The Kids can find their way to the Pigeons’ Nest by pursuing a pigeon, or by talking to the ornithologist Christopher Boyd or with Stacey at Donald Dixon’s house. A hundred pigeons have settled on the northern part of [CHANGE] Svartsjölandet on a cliff overlooking Spånviken. They are building a huge nest of branches, pieces of metal, and glass shards, and will defend it in large numbers against other birds, predators, and humans. The pigeons constantly talk to each other about the quality of the building materials, and they fight over mating and food. Their voices are metallic, and their words interspersed with chirping. The nest is being watched by groups of gulls, black-headed gulls, and great cormorants that attack unwary pigeons, pecking them to death. With a successful Intelligence roll, a Kid understands that the Killer Birds are trying to take control over the pigeons who are working together to protect the nest and each other. If the Kids study the Killer Birds, they suddenly fly away, as if they heard a command, and disappear out over the water.

# TROUBLE It is a hard to climb up to the nest. The Kids need to pass sharp rocks and tall cliffs. They have to roll move or sneak to get close to the nest without being seen. If the pigeons spot the Kids, they become quiet and gather around the nest. Groups of pigeons begin to circle in the air above the Kids. If the Kids continue forward, the pigeons attack them. The Kids have no choice but to leave, and must roll force or move, suffering a Condition if they fail.

# CLUES

# The nest is constructed of a variety of branches and objects stolen from the north of Svartsjölandet and Nordiska Gobi [CHANGE]. In the nest, there are also several rusted metal pieces from the MagLev ship where Lena and Donald created the birds. Kids who successfully investigate will find a piece of metal that is labeled IEX-4Z32. With a successful knowledge or investigation roll, the Kids will understand that this is the identification number of a MagLev ship. With the help of a library, they can find out which ship and where it is. When the Kids leave the Pigeons’ Nest, they see a young woman several hundred meters away watching the birds through binoculars. She gets up, and rides off on a bike heading south. This is Stacey Johnson. If the Kids follow her, she will lead them to Donald Dixon’s abandoned house near Kungsberga [CHANGE].

# LOCATION 3: DONALD’S ABANDONED HOUSE

# The Kids can get to Donald’s house by listening to adults talk about his animal experiments, by talking to the ornithologist Christopher Boyd or by following Stacey from the Pigeons’ Nest. They can also be saved by Stacey and her dog when they are attacked by birds, and invited to “her” house. The House is a two-story, yellow brick house with red roof tiles. Donald was bewildered by Lena’s invitation to help her with her experiments with birds and left his house immediately without cleaning or emptying the fridge or taking out the garbage. The house is messy and dirty. Everywhere, there are cables, tools, and strange drawings. The bookshelves are filled with books about birds, neurology, and animal behaviour, but also books about love, courting, and how to make that special someone notice you. The living room walls have a dozen framed photographs of famous scientists. Next to Einstein hangs a photo of Lena, a middle-aged woman with curly blonde hair, white clothes, and a proud gaze. On her lab coat, there is a pin with the Yin and Yang symbols. On a VHS player lies a copy of Alfred Hitchcock’s movie The Birds. All over the house, there are framed photographs of Lena and Donald, with Gunnar often in the background, smiling insecurely and looking at Lena. For the last few months, 15-year-old “Stacey” has been secretly living in the house. She comes from central [CHANGE] and has run away from home because of her controlling and intrusive stepdad. Stacey has brought her dog, the wire-haired dachshund named Bullen, who is fat and happy, and protects Stacey with great zeal. Bullen is limping on one leg after being beaten by the stepdad. Stacey has paid attention to the Killer Birds since she was attacked by a group of gulls. She has killed a bird which she has examined with a knife, a pair of pliers, and some scissors on Donald’s kitchen table. Stacey is related to Donald. He is her uncle, and she used to visit him as a child. She suspects him of somehow being responsible for the Killer Birds, but she doesn’t know where he is. Stacey misses her little sister. If things turn out well with the Kids, she may consider becoming a pretend sister to one of them and may well be included as an NPC in future Mysteries.

# TROUBLE

# If the Kids try to get into Donald’s house, they have to sneak past a couple of birds who, after seeing Stacey sneak around, have taken it upon themselves to catch her. They take turns patrolling on bike paths and trails. The front door of the house is locked. It is possible to get in through the high fence at the back of the house, so as to prevent people seeing into the garden or the house. The patio door has been left unlocked. Stacey will hide at first, but if the Kids go into the house she lets Bullen loose, who comes rushing in with loud barks. She steps forward with a kitchen knife, and screams at them to leave or she will hurt them. She tells them to keep quiet about her living there, if they know what is best for them. The Kids can make her change her mind with a successful charm roll. Using empathy, they realize that she is very lonely, and scared of being discovered and sent home. She would really like to get to know other people. “Stacey” doesn’t, under any circumstances, trust adults. She will not follow the Kids to Nordiska Gobi [Sentinel Island] for fear of being seen by adults.

# CLUES

# Stacey knows about the Pigeons’ Nest and understands that the pigeons are not dangerous. Stacey knows about the ornithologist, Christopher Boyd, and thinks that he knows more, but she has not talked to him. Among Donald’s things, there are drawings of birds and microchips. Those who manage to study them and roll successfully on Investigate [CHANGE], see that they are meant to be used to build a machine that will attract birds automatically, and modify them. The chips are supposed to let a person control the birds, but the blueprints seem to be missing details on how that control will work – as if the person who made the drawings stopped in the middle of the work. Hidden under Donald’s bed can be found his diary. He writes about his work at the Facility. In many places in Donald’s notes, he writes about his love for the amazing Lena, who is not only beautiful but also a genius scientist who will one day win the Nobel Prize. He writes about the colleagues who don’t understand Lena, and work against her and treat her badly. Donald describes his monumental sadness when she was forced to quit her job. But a couple of weeks later, he is overwhelmed with happiness as Lena has asked him to work with him on a new experiment in a place called “IEX-4Z32.” A Kid who makes a knowledge or investigate roll knows that it is the ID number of a MagLev ship, but she must study at a library to get more information.

# THE SHOWDOWN

# Nordiska Gobi is an area of islands in the northeastern part of Munsö [CHANGE] with a large amount of debris and remnants of various technological marvels. The water is full of rusty pieces with razor sharp edges, ships half-submerged in the water, and strange domes, circular towers, and MagLev disks. When the Kids enter this area, it is quiet and still. In the distance, the Killer Birds can be seen patrolling the skies. The wreck of the MagLev ship IEX-4Z32 lies on the small island of Skärholmen [CHANGE]. The Kids must either swim (requires a force roll) to get there or find a boat of some kind (rolling for tinker or contact[CHANGE]). IEX-4Z32 is a 25-meter-long wreck, lying tilted to one side. The ship was previously painted black, but is now largely rust-colored. On the old antennas, birds sit looking out over the water. On the side of the ship, close to the ground, there is a door that is blocked from the outside by a metal beam. If opened, it slides to the side revealing stairs leading up. Birds fly in and out of the wreckage through vents. Machine fans and bird chirping can be heard from inside the ship. Just inside the door, there is a machine room and storage facilities. The Kids have to climb up through the tilted ship to the cockpit at the top of the vessel, where Lena and Donald have built a machine with multiple bird feeders filled with bird food. The machine looks like an arcade game, with blinking lights and long metallic arms. The machine is powered by a large generator with a battery. There are hundreds of birds here, and every surface is covered by bird droppings, feathers and carcasses of dead birds. There are also a number of tools to be found in the room that can be used as weapons (+1 bonus). are supposed to let a person control the birds, but the blueprints seem to be missing details on how that control will work – as if the person who made the drawings stopped in the middle of the work.

# Donald lives in a small storage room, close to the cockpit with a half-eaten package of crackers and an almost empty bottle of soda. This is where he spends his time when he’s not using the machine to transform more birds. If Donald spots the Kids, he will stay hidden and spy on them until they reach the cockpit. Then he will appear, threatening to kill them if they don’t leave. Donald is very dirty and his body is covered by small wounds from the birds’ pecking. His hair and beard are unkempt and his eyes are glazed over with an insane stare. He looks like – and is – a madman. He expresses both love and hate for Lena, his “beloved,” but does not reveal her name.

# EXAMPLE

# The Gamemaster: You manage to haul the metal beam off to the side, and open the door without being seen. The door opens, gliding to the side with a soft sound. From inside, comes the smell of bird droppings. The ladder inside leads up at an angle because the ship is lying tilted on the ground.

# Player 2 (Anita): I slowly climb inside, listening to hear where the machine is, but also taking care not to be heard.

# Gamemaster: Roll sneak. In fact, all of you should roll, since I guess all of you will be climbing inside, right?

# Player 1 (Olle) and 3 (Dennis): Yes.

# Player 2: Success, and one extra success.

# Player 3: Can I get help from your extra success? My roll failed.

# Player 2: Sure! The Gamemaster: How do you help him?

# Player 2: Dennis is about to trip on a wire sticking out from the wall when I hiss at him, “Watch it!”

# The Gamemaster: Okay, you all succeed, and you crawl and climb up inside the ship. You hear sounds from the top of the ship, in the cockpit. There are several birds, and one that sounds like a bird of prey. What do you do?

# TROUBLE

# To avoid being spotted by patrolling birds on the way to Skärholmen [Sentinel Island], Kids need to make sneak rolls. Failing this roll requires them to get away, and if they fail again they will suffer a Condition. They will also suffer a Condition if they fail a roll for force in order to haul away the metal beam from in front of the door. Sneaking through the ship to the cockpit without being spotted by Donald requires a sneak roll for each Kid. If any of the Kids fail their roll, Donald will notice them. He will call for the Goshawk using the machine, and he will be waiting for the Kids in the cockpit. If all of the Kids make their sneak rolls, Donald will be caught by surprise and emerge from the storage room only when the Kids have reached the cockpit. Then he will call for the Goshawk, which arrives after a few minutes to attack the Kids. Lots of smaller Killer Birds will follow the Goshawk in battle. The confrontation with Donald and the Goshawk counts as Extended Trouble. The Threat Level is normal (twice the number of Kids) if Kids surprise Donald, but hard (three times the number of Kids) is they failed their sneak rolls.

# Donald can be handled in several different ways. The Kids can charm him to make him see the error of his ways, they can use force to wrestle him to the ground, or tinker or program to break the bird machine. To deal with the Goshawk and the rest of the Killer Birds, the Kids can, for example, use move to outrun them, or force to fight the birds’ onslaught. Reward players who think up creative ways of dealing with the threat

# If the Kids succeed, Donald will break down in tears, the machine will break down, the birds will be chased off, or a combination of the above. In any case, the scourge of the killer birds is over. The Kids have stopped the production of Killer Birds, and those that exist will soon die of infections caused by the microchips. If the Kids didn’t kill the Goshawk, it will be seen soaring over the Facility area in future Mysteries, and it might even nest near the Kids’ homes. If the Kids fail to overcome the Extended Trouble, they will be chased off the ship by Donald and the birds. A wave of Killer Birds will haunt the area for the entire summer, causing severe problems until the machine eventually breaks down by itself. THE GOSHAWK The Goshawk has the special attribute SHARP BEAK 2, but this is only used if a Kid confronts it outside of the Extended Trouble

# AFTER THE SHOWDOWN

# Even if the Kids manage to stop Donald, he will never admit to what he has done. The technology of the bird machine is strange, and even if the Kids show it to some adults, they won’t believe it had anything to do with the bird attacks. Most of the birds with implants will escape. Even if the Kids manage to catch one and show it to the police, they won’t connect it to the bird attacks. Donald will not tell anyone about Lena or her part in what has happened. His love for her is strong, but he has finally understood that she will never love him back. Donald will, in the coming months, leave his house and move away from the area. He will let Stacey live in his house as long as she wants to.

#  AFTERMATH

# The Kids now get a scene each from Everyday Life, with or without Trouble. The player may choose a scene, or ask the Gamemaster to set up a scene. If the group is short on time, each player can give a brief snapshot of a moment in the Kid’s everyday life instead.

# CHANGE

# You and the players should go through the character sheets together, and figure out if the Kids have changed in some way. The players may, if they want to, change their Problem, Pride, Iconic Items and Relationships. Remember, each Kid gets 1 XP for each affirmative answer. If they get 5 XP, they may raise a skill one level

# NPCS

# CHRISTOPHER BOYD

# “The woodpecker strikes with its sharp beak eight to ten times a second. It can make holes in cement. Imagine what would happen if it attacked your skull.”

# Christopher Boyd has loved birds since he was a child. He became a well-known figure on a nature program on television but was bitten by a swan. No one knows if it was fear after the bite or the wound infection that changed Christopher, but he became introverted, paranoid, and terrified of the birds he once loved. He lost his job, his wife, and lost touch with his children and friends. Christopher is still obsessed with birds, and surrounds himself with birdcages, LPs with bird calls, posters with birds, and books about birds. But instead of studying them with love, he looks at them with horror. Christopher is convinced that sooner or later, the birds will join forces and attack mankind. He wants to be as prepared as possible and know his enemies.

# Christopher is a large bald man with a big beard. He has huge hands but a thin, almost girlish voice. He is dressed in dirty wildlife clothes, and has a pair of binoculars and a notepad ready at hand.

# STACEY JOHNSON

# “Don’t tell your parents, they will send me home.”

# 15-year-old Stacey grew up with a single mother working two jobs and a little sister in central Stockholm [CHANGE]. She is tough and hard to scare. Yet that’s exactly what happened. The mother’s new boyfriend is a violent man, who took the opportunity to come on to Stacey as soon as they were home alone. Very soon, Stacey couldn’t take it any longer. She took her dog, the dachshund Bullen, and fled to the Atilles Islands [CHANGE] where her uncle Donald [Donald] lives, whom she used to visit on summer vacations as a child. Now, she hides in Donald’s abandoned house, and lives on what she has found in the pantry. She suspects that her uncle Donald is somehow connected to the Killer Birds. Stacey was attacked by a group of gulls, and she has taken up the fight against the birds. She avoids talking to adults; she doesn’t want to be sent home. At night, she screams in her dreams. Stacey is a tanned and wiry young woman, with her blonde hair full of hairspray. She wears colorful sunglasses, a shirt with Minnie Mouse on it, and constantly chews gum or smokes. She misses her little sister, Tove, and might “adopt” one of the Kids.

# DONALD DIXON

# “She is the most brilliant scientist ever born!”

# Donald is a man shaped by a childhood filled with bullying, violence, and loneliness. He has always been shunned by other people and expects nothing else. Only in science has he found a safe and welcoming haven. Donald is a biologist who specializes in bird neurology. He has worked many years at the Facility, constructing cyborg brain implants. When he met Lena, he instantly fell in love with her, and started to follow her around like a puppy. She used him, but never gave him any sign of appreciation. Donald thought she had finally fallen in love with him when she asked him to quit his job and work with her on her bird experiments. Now, he’s realizing that yet again, he’s been used. Donald hasn’t had any contact with Stacey for years. He loves her like his own child, but doesn’t really know how to show his feelings to her. Donald is a thin, middle-aged man with untidy, long, blond hair. He dresses in an extremely dirty science lab coat and lisps when he speaks.

## GROWN UP ATTRACTION

#### AUTUMN

# The autumn wind is brisk and chilly. The calm of everyday life settles over the area. But something else is in the air. A taste of something forbidden, something unnaturally tempting. The Kids notice how adults behave strangely, becoming victims of desire. Can the nefarious plot be stopped in time or will the grown-ups go willingly to their own doom?

# This is a Mystery that can be played over the course of one session. It can be used as the second part of the Four Seasons of Mad Scientist campaign.

# THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY

# EDIT FROM HERE

# The scientist Lena Thelin has wanted to take revenge on her former colleagues and managers at Rask Energy ever since she was fired. Recently Lena has invented a machine that has the ability to attract people, making them want to stay close to it and protect it, and arousing their most primitive instincts, aggression, hierarchical thinking, and sexuality. Lena’s plan was to place her invention, which she calls the Artificial Attachment Node (the ArAN), on Svartsjölandet [ADD], so all the adults on the Mälaren Islands [ADD] would be drawn to it. Then she would enter the research facilities and take what she wanted, destroying the rest. The ArAN requires huge amounts of energy. Lena needed to connect it to the Gravitron. She managed to find and enter an underground tunnel near the access tunnel P-1 on Väntholmen on Svartsjölandet [ADD]. She placed the ArAN on Väntholmen, linked it to the Gravitron, and started it. It immediately began to attract adults. Lena realized her mistake too late, as she is also an adult, and was instantly imprisoned by her own creation.

# INTRODUCING THE KIDS

# Each Kid gets a scene from Everyday Life. The Gamemaster should try to include adults in the scenes, so that they can be attracted by the ArAN and disappear later in the story. Dad taps on the door, and offers cookies. An aunt stays at the house because she’s on vacation (but everyone knows that she recently gambled away all her money and had to sell her house).

# INTRODUCING THE MYSTERY

# An adult disappears. It can be a teacher, a parent, or an older sibling. The person is 16 years of age or older and has slipped away without being seen. The Kid wakes up in the morning, and her mother is gone. The teacher doesn’t turn up to class. The older brother’s room is empty in the morning, and the bed is still made. A successful investigate roll lets the Kid discover that the adult left in the middle of whatever she was doing, and that she has made an effort to leave unseen. There are no signs of the adult having been abducted against her will, and there are no traces of other people helping or following her. If the Kid follows the adult’s tracks, she loses them somewhere on the way to Väntholmen [Hemenway Pass ADD]

# SOLVING THE MYSTERY

# The Mystery unfolds on and near Väntholmen [Hemenway Pass ADD] on Svartsjölandet [outside Boulder City]. Mix scenes where the Kids try to solve the Mystery with scenes from Everyday Life, and scenes linked to the countdown of how The ArAN affects the islands’ population. More adults disappear, one by one. This affects each Kid’s Everyday Life. If mom disappears, dad will obviously get upset and worried. Maybe he tries to comfort the Kid, or gently find out if the Kid knows something about mom having a love affair. Perhaps he sends the Kid to hear if the neighbours have seen something? If the Kids met Stacey [Stacey] in the Mystery Summer Break and Killer Birds, she can be one of the people affected by the ArAN.

# LOCATION 1: THE ARAN

# The ArAN machine has been placed in the middle of a fenced meadow, between the forest and the beach on the southern side of Väntholmen, next to a farm [close to Hemenway Pass ADD]. The Kids can find it by following an adult who tries to sneak away unseen. This requires a successful sneak roll. If the roll fails, the Kids have lost the adult somewhere on the way and must find some other adult who sneaks away from home. The ArAN consists of a shiny metal cylinder on the ground, one meter high and two meters wide. Black letters on the side of the cylinder form the words ArAN. The first time the Kids see the ArAN, it is surrounded by twenty adults sitting and standing, talking, and looking out into the distance, seemingly at peace. One of them is Lena Thelin. She is a middle-aged woman with curly blonde hair, white clothes, and a proud gaze. If asked what she is doing in the meadow, she says she's studying insects modified by radiation from the Gravitron. If the Kids approach, they are stopped by the adults who say that this is not a good place for Kids and ask them to go home. If asked what they are doing here, the adults have reasonable explanations – they are looking at the beautiful view, having a moment to themselves for thinking, or they are looking for a place to build a country house. If the Kids press the issue, the adults become aggressive and then use force to make the Kids leave. The ArAN affects adults in the northern part of Svartsjölandet [Hemenway ADD], but it is getting stronger and its influence reaches further every hour that passes. If the Kids bring other grown-ups to the ArAN, such as parents or cops, they too fall victim to its influence and join the group in the meadow. The next time the characters visit the place, there will be significantly more adults present.

# TROUBLE

# If the Kids try to get to the ArAN by force or cunning, they will be stopped by the adults. To pass them is impossible, and the players may not even roll to try. Let the players describe what the Kids are trying to do, and then tell them what happens as they fail. Provided with some kind of battering ram or a tractor from a nearby farm, the Kids may try to get to the ArAN using force or tinker. The crowd has the special attribute dense crowd 3, which means that it requires three successes for the Kids to force their way through the crowd using that skill. If the Kids manage to get to the ArAN it has steel hull 2, which means that the Kids need two successes to destroy it. The adults will continue to attack the Kids until the ArAN is destroyed. When it is finally destroyed, the adults immediately cease to attack and head home. Their minds unconsciously create a more or less reasonable explanation for what has happened. No one will believe the Kids if they talk about what has happened.

# CLUES

# If the Kids examine the surroundings using investigate, they see that heavy cables lead from the ArAN into the ground. The Kids cannot reach these without getting to the ArAN. There are other, thinner cables leading from the ArAN north into the woods. If the Kids follow these, they come upon an Echo Sphere (below) lying on the ground. If they fail the roll to investigate, they see the cables anyway but don’t get to roll to try to discover the robot hiding in the woods next to the Echo Sphere (below). A Kid who makes a calculate roll understands that the ArAN affects the grown-ups with some kind of subliminal vibrations. This requires huge amounts of energy, which probably means that the metal cylinder is connected to the Gravitron. If this connection is broken, the machine will lose its influence. A Kid who makes an empathize roll realizes that the adults are becoming more bestial as time goes by.

# THE ARAN MAKES ADULTS:

# ■ Want to get close to it. Its effect is reinforced by the Moon, which makes most adults sneak away during the night.

# ■ Want to hide its existence from other people, thus the reason for sneaking away to it.

# ■ Prevent others from getting near or damaging it. They are prepared to sacrifice their lives for the ArAN.

# ■ Act more like animals or primitive Stone Age people. They become more aggressive, sexually active, and uninhibited. They form tribal hierarchies, where some lead and others follow.

# ■ Ignore their own needs for food, drink, sleep, and medical treatment, which will eventually lead to health problems and death.

# ■ Forget the ability to speak, and start communicating with grunts and gestures.

# ■ Not understand that it is the ArAN that affects them. If asked, they will find an excuse for being on the site, and believe it themselves.

# ■ The ArAN only effects people of ages 16 and up

# THE ECHO SPHERE

# Cables buried in the soil lead from the ArAN to an Echo Sphere, located in a forest glade about a hundred meters to the north. Lena has used the abandoned Echo Sphere to program and control The ArAN. She hid it so no one will see it, and attempted to bury the cables leading to it. The sphere is brown and somewhat rusty, two meters in diameter, and weighs 800 kilograms. Besides the cables running from the ArAN, there is an open hatch on the Sphere where thick cables lead into the ground. Lena has placed a robot in the woods near the Echo Sphere. It has been instructed to guard the Echo Sphere, and chase away anyone who approaches. Lena has dressed the robot in clothes, so that it will be mistaken for a person if anyone sees it. The robot is named Isaac.

# TROUBLE

# Tell the Kids that they feel like they are not alone when they approach the Echo Sphere. They must make investigate rolls to spot Isaac in the woods. If they fail, Isaac approaches them unnoticed. Isaac has been instructed to scare people away from the Echo Sphere, and, if necessary, to attack them. He will step out of the forest, stare at them, and with a mechanical voice ask them to leave this place. If the Kids try to talk to him, they may roll empathize to understand his motives. If they succeed, they realize that Isaac doesn’t want to hurt anybody. Even though he has been ordered to protect the Echo Sphere, he suspects that it is there for a bad reason. The Kids can charm Isaac to come with them to the ArAN. If they do, Isaac realizes that something has gone wrong, and lets them investigate and shut down the Echo Sphere. He warns them of trying to cut the cables. If the Kids manage to charm Isaac, he can also tell them that the ArAN is connected to the Gravitron through underground service tunnels. He doesn’t know where the entrance is, but he can tell the Kids that the service engineer responsible for the area must know. Isaac refers to Lena as his “master,” but will not betray her name. He tells the Kids that his master has placed two dangerous robots in the underground tunnels to guard the cable connecting the ArAN to the Gravitron. If the Kids cooperate with Isaac, he can become a recurring character in future Mysteries. If the Kids don’t talk to Isaac, and start examining the Echo Sphere or the cables leading to it, he will attack them. He uses his electrical shock grips. If the Kids fail to defend themselves (by rolling dex or force), they suffer the Injured Condition, and get chased away. Isaac will not prevent them from leaving.

# If the Kids cut the cables to the Echo Sphere with an axe or similar tool, the Sphere will explode and all Kids close by must roll force. If they fail, they are immediately Broken. A Kid who studies the Sphere with program/machinery realises that this will happen, and that it is possible instead to turn off the Sphere. This requires some time and a successful program roll. If the Kids succeed in shutting down the Echo Sphere, it slows down the increase of the ArAN’s power of attraction. It also eventually leads to the ArAN self-destructing, as the Sphere stops stabilizing it – but not before many of the adults in the meadow get hurt.

# CLUES

# Using investigation, the Kids can figure out that the ArAN draws its power from the Gravitron. If they find the connection in the service tunnels beneath the ArAN and break it, the ArAN will stop working. Only service engineers employed at the Facility know the locations of the entrances to the service tunnels. A note on the Echo Sphere itself – it’s so small and worn that it requires an investigation roll to find, which also tells the Kids that the service engineer responsible for this area is (or at least was) named Michael Wirsén [Mike Warren].

# COUNTDOWN

# Advance the Countdown each time the Kids visit the ArAN, or when it feels right and the story needs more energy.

# 1. The influence of the ArAN is increasing, and more adults are being drawn to the site. The adults are becoming more aggressive, primitive, and sexually active. The meadow smells of excrement, and several adults are bleeding after violent fights.

# 2. Even more adults are drawn to the site, from as far as southern Svartsjölandet and Munsö [Hemenway]. A police car arrives at the site to find out what is going on, and the policemen become victims of the ArAN, too. The adults have a clear hierarchy within the group, and fight amongst themselves. All the adults are naked and walk with a crouched posture. Hideous things are happening.

# 3. Yet more adults are drawn to the site, now even people from Adelsö [Boulder City]. An ambulance and a group of journalists have been drawn to the site, and join the others in the meadow. The adults have stopped using words, some are walking on all fours, and people suffer from fluid loss and hunger. Soon, people will start dying.

# LOCATION 3: THE SERVICE ENGINEER’S HOUSE

# If the Kids ask around for information about the service tunnels, they will learn about service engineer Michael Wirsén, who is responsible for the northern parts of Svartsjölandet [Boulder City ADD]. They can find him through contact, comprehend, by studying the Echo Sphere, through the library, or by asking an adult. Michael has recently been injured in an accident, and is bedridden in the family's summer home near Väntholmen [Hemenway Pass ADD]. Michael has suffered an electric shock, trying to repair an electrical cable. He has suffered brain damage, which has made him insensitive to the vibrations from the ArAN. He is tucked in bed on the second floor of the house in a red pajamas with teddy bears, and is being taken care of by his wife and a nurse. When the Kids find him, both the wife and the nurse have suffered from the effects of the ArAN machine and left Michael alone in his bed. The summer house is a two-story cottage painted red with white corners. It is very well maintained and meticulously decorated, but rather soulless. On the walls, framed posters of popular artists hang; one of Michael’s avocations is pop music. The first floor is furnished as an office. Here, Michael keeps a large number of drawings and books about the Facility; his second avocation is his job.

# TROUBLE

# Michael is in his bed, and will not answer the door if the Kids ring the bell. The house has doors that lock automatically, and an advanced alarm which begins to howl and alerts the police if someone tries to break in. The Kids can hotwire it using program. Failing the roll triggers the alarm, and soon the police will show up (unless the ArAN is now affecting the entire population).

# Michael is very worried about suddenly being left alone. He is confused and disoriented. He will alternate between seeing the Kids as burglars and trying to chase them away, and believing the Kids are his childhood friends and that he himself is a child. It is very difficult to have a conversation with him, as he quickly goes between these extremes. If the Kids make an empathy roll, they understand that they should pretend to be his friends to get him to help them. They can do this by using charm. If they fail, Michael understands that they are trying to trick him and becomes aggressive.

# CLUES

# If the Kids get Michael to help them, he will tell them that the only hatch that could have been used to connect the ArAN to the Graviton is the one that leads down to Access Tunnel P-1. He can give them the service code that enables them to open the hatch, and shows them where it is on a map. If Michael doesn’t cooperate, the Kids can get the same information by studying his maps and books. This requires a comprehend roll. The Kids may also use contact to get the same information from someone else.

# THE SHOWDOWN The Kids find the overgrown hatch in the woods, north of the ArAN and the Echo Sphere. Beneath the grass, there is a concrete slab with a heavy hatch that opens with a code. A staircase leads down into dark passages that seem endless. When the Kids climb down, small blue LEDs light up on the walls. In some places, there are emergency telephones on the walls. It is humid, and a cold wind blows through the tunnels. Every now and then, the Kids can hear what sounds like footsteps and animals moving somewhere in the dark. Cobwebs smear the Kids’ faces if they don’t bat them out of the way. After twenty minutes of walking, the Kids come to a large Service Room with several entrances. The walls are covered by cables, screens, and control stations. The floor is a mesh of rusty metal, now in bad condition. Several meters below, the groundwater flows with a loud roar. It smells bad. From the ceiling hangs a green cable that is hotwired to one of the stations. The cable leads up to the ArAN, and connects it to the Gravitron

# In two alcoves, two robots are hiding. Lena placed them here to guard the cable. The Kids have to make investigate rolls to spot them. The robots, called Yin and Yang, will attack if the Kids enter the room. The confrontation with the robots Yin and Yang counts as Extended Trouble with a Threat Level equal to three times the number of Kids. The Kids can flee rolling move, or stand their ground and roll force. Another way to overcome the robots is to make a hole in the metal mesh (using tinker) and lure the robots to fall through it and into the water below. If the Kids fail, they are chased off by the robots. If the Kids overcome the robots, they can unplug the cable to the ArAN. It then loses its connection to the Gravitron, and immediately breaks down. The adults go back home with varying explanations about what happened in the meadow, none of them true.

# AFTER THE SHOWDOWN

# If the Kids succeed, the adults have already gone home once they come up from the service tunnel. Lena has disappeared. The adults won’t remember or understand what has happened, and no one will thank the Kids. If the Kids fail to outsmart or beat the robots, the ArAN keeps affecting the adults, making the situation grow worse. Some will die and some will suffer from serious dehydration. All the time, more adults will arrive. One day, without warning, the machine stops working.

# AFTERMATH

# Afterwards, the Kids get a scene each from Everyday Life, with or without Trouble. The player may choose a scene or ask the Gamemaster to set up a scene. If the group is short on time, each player instead describes a brief snapshot of a moment in the Kid’s Everyday Life. CHANGE After the final scenes, you and the players should go through the character sheets together and figure out if the Kids have changed in any way. The players can change their Problem, Pride, Iconic Item, and Relationships. Ask the questions for Experience Points out loud. Each Kid gets 1 XP for each affirmative answer.

# NPCS AND CREATURES

# This section describes the NPCs and creatures that the Kids might meet in this Mystery. ISAAC “Be so kind as to leave this place immediately, for your own protection and the common good. I do not want to repeat this request.” Isaac is an old robot, who has been in the service of Lena for many years. He is beginning to understand more and more about people, and has begun to doubt Lena’s motives. Isaac suspects that Lena is planning to scrap him. He has started to think of himself as almost a human being, and the prospect of being scrapped scares him. He has learned to talk with an upper class Stockholm accent, and has studied how to behave like an old-time gentleman. In his shack, he collects pipes, stamps, and expensive canes, which he buys with money earned from secretly selling spare parts from Lena’s supply to a shady scrap dealer on Svartsjölandet [Hemenway]. Isaac has a good (but mechanical) heart, and loves kids. Isaac has a body built of human tissue and metal. His head looks like a skull with a metallic mouth containing black teeth that always seem to sneer. Isaac wears a dark raincoat, and a large, dark green rain hat, and walks with

# a beautifully engraved cane. He talks in a long-winded manner, with a lot of difficult words and is overly polite. Isaac can use his right hand to create a powerful electric shock that lights up like a flashbulb. When he does this, his teeth also crackle with electric sparks.

# MICHAEL WIRSÉN [MIKE WARREN]

# “Let’s ride our bikes to the headmaster’s house and steal plums! Wait ... Who are you? What are you doing here?! Get out of my house!!!”

# Michael is a pedantic man in his thirties, who loves his work as much as he does pop music. He grew up on the island in Stenhamra [in Boulder CIty], and has recently inherited his parents’ summer house close to Väntholmen [Hemenway Pass]. Recently, he injured himself at work, and is now being pampered by his wife and a nurse. This is very timely for Michael, as his wife has been threatening to leave him for a long time because he doesn’t want to have children. When his wife disappears, at first he believes that she has left him, but then he realizes that others are also missing. Michael is seriously injured, confused, dizzy, and weak. He sometimes thinks that he is a child, and it is the 1960s. Michael is clean shaven, with short brown hair and brown eyes. He is dressed in a pair of pajamas, is bandaged, and has large burn marks on the upper part of his body and on his face.

# YIN AND YANG

# “Click, click, click, wooooeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!”

# Yin is human-like and made out of white plastic, with a round head and black eyes. One of its hands has a mounted high-speed drill that gives off a loud screeching noise. The joints of Yin click when it moves with stiff steps, but it is still a good runner. Yang is a black metal robot, in the shape of a square block that moves on caterpillar tracks. It has no head and no visible limbs. A series of red LEDs light up when it moves. Yang can extend a long metallic shaft equipped with an electric shock mechanism, which lights up the entire room with a flash when it strikes a victim. Yang moves with a hissing sound, like that of a snake

## CREATURES FROM THE CRETACEOUS

# The cold of winter rules the land. Kids with rosy cheeks have snowball fights until they are called home to warmth and hot cocoa. Skaters crisscross the ice-laden lake in leasure. One day, however, a skater disappears into thin air. The Kids will discover that whatever took him, might be better left undisturbed. This is a Mystery that can be played during a single session. It can be used as the third part of the Four Seasons of Mad Science campaign. The Mystery is written so as to scare the Kids, and to give them a sense of desperation and vulnerability. In the end, they will hopefully overcome all Trouble and solve the Mystery.

# THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY The scientist Lena Thelin has decided to give herself an early Christmas present. She has opened a time portal to the Cretaceous Period, in order to collect dinosaur eggs. She plans to hatch them in a barn, tame the dinosaurs, and then use them to take revenge on her former colleagues at Riksenergi [DARPA]. Lena has managed to retrieve several eggs, which she has placed in incubators, but on the last trip back in time something went wrong. Lena caught a disease, and is not well enough to return to her own time. Dinosaurs have made their way through the time portal and have started to spread over Adelsö [Red Mountain], attacking pets and people. More beasts are coming through the portal, and it’s only a matter of time before chaos breaks out, just in time for Christmas. The Mystery begins with the Kids trying to find a runaway dog. They discover Lena’s farm, the dinosaurs, and the portal to the Cretaceous. The Kids have to travel back in time, and find Lena in order to close the time portal.

INTRODUCING THE KIDS

Set a scene from Everyday Life for each of the Kids, with or without Trouble. Maybe the Kids ski, make oranges with clove and red laces or they are forced to shovel the driveway. Make sure to mention that the long distance skater Nikolas Evans disappeared two days earlier. Maybe the adults talk about it, or it is mentioned on TV. The skater, Nikolas, has been eaten by one of the dinosaurs on Adelsö [on Red Mountain], but no one knows it yet. In another scene, have a Kid hear a local radio show where an old lady on Adelsö claims to have seen big animals, “maybe bears,” lurking in the darkness outside her house. Her name is Birgitta Nylander [Dorothy Greene], a known local yokel. She calls in to the radio show; but her connection is really bad, and the call is suddenly cut off. The journalist cracks jokes about old women and tired minds. 

## INTRODUCING THE MYSTERY

The Kids see a poster with a picture of a golden retriever named “Goldie” who has disappeared. Goldie ran away from her family in Sätuna on Svartsjölandet [Boulder Beach] three days ago. A fisherman [camper] saw her out on the ice on Svinsundet between Munsö and Adelsö, heading towards Adelsö, near Wäsby [towards River Mountains]. The family offers $25] to anyone who can find Goldie. This is a lot of money in the ’80s. If the players don’t get hooked by this bait, remind them of their Drives. Before continuing to the next phase, the Kids must find a way to get away from their families and get to Adelsö. It’s a long walk, and takes all day on foot. It isn’t possible to go there and come back on the same day. Maybe one of the Kids knows about an empty cottage on Adelsö, where they can stay while they solve the Mystery. Getting away from home and going to Adelsö can be played out over several scenes with Trouble (lying to parents, getting a ride with a truck driver, stealing food from home without being seen, etc.), or you and the players can agree on how they get there, and cut directly to a scene where the Kids are crossing the lake between Munsö and Adelsö.

Normally, there is a ferry crossing Svinsundet between Munsö and Adelsö, and its route is kept clear of ice with an icebreaker. You can decide that the ferries are still running or that the icebreakers are needed elsewhere, and all the ferries have been cancelled. The Kids will then need to cross Svinsundet on foot. It’s more difficult to set scenes from Everyday Life in this Mystery because the Kids are not in their home area. Scenes from Everyday Life can be about the relationships between the Kids, how they cook food, fight amongst themselves or flirt with each other. You can let some of the parents be on a fishing holiday on Adelsö, or one or more of the parents can come looking for the Kids on Adelsö. If the Kids create or find some kind of shelter or home at Adelsö, it counts as their Hideout during this Mystery. The Kids are safe there, and they can heal Conditions. You can let them find an old fishing cabin or a summer cottage.

# THE TEENS

# No matter how the Kids get to Adelsö, the Teens Mara, Mackan, and Taggen [Mara, Muffin and Spike] will confront them on their way across the ice to Adelsö, or on the shore at Adelsö [Boulder Beach]. They have also decided to find Goldie and collect the money, and they don’t want any competition. During the Mystery, the Teens will give the Kids a hard time so as to get them to give up and go home. Mara, Mackan, and Taggen are three troublemakers who have skipped school for several weeks. They plan to form a punk band and move to Las Vegas, and they need money to buy instruments. One of the Kids may have met them before; they could be friends or enemies to one of the Kids’ big sisters or brothers. Advance the Countdown for the Teens as the Mystery unravels

# THE DINOSAURS

# Some thirty creatures from the Cretaceous Period have come through Lena’s time portal, and more are on the way. Most of these are small animals like Eomaia, herbivores like Triceratops, or fish eaters like Pterosaurs, but there are also dangerous carnivores like Velociraptors and a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex. The cold makes the animals lethargic and weak, and some of them are dying. The carnivores eat small animals and pets. One human has been killed, the long distance skater Nikolas Evans [Nicholas Evans]. It is only a matter of time before the hungry animals will attack people on a bigger scale. The Kids will see more and more of the Dinosaurs as you advance the Countdown.

# ICY WINDS AND SNOW

# The roads on Adelsö are snowed over, and telephone and electric lines have been torn down by the dinosaurs. The only way to get around is to walk, or to find and hotwire a vehicle that can travel on snow. Traveling and finding shelter and food can be made into constant Trouble that will make the Mystery more difficult, and create a feeling of being truly in dire straits. If it seems too hard for the players, or if the group doesn’t have much time, these endeavors can be described to set the mood instead of being Trouble

# It takes almost an hour for the Kids to walk one kilometer in the heavy snow. Use the table on this page to determine how long a trip takes. Each time the Kids try to go somewhere, they all have to roll force. If they fail, they are either lost, Exhausted or Injured from the cold. If they don’t find shelter for the night, or if they lack food for a long time, they must make a force roll or be Broken. Kids travelling at night or off roads or paths also need to succeed at comprehend rolls to avoid getting lost. Make sure to keep track of time. The sun rises just before 9 am, and sets at 3 pm. Scenes from Everyday Life can be made here, in which Kids look for food, eat or are just about to go to sleep. There are a couple of small villages and isolated farms on Adelsö, where the Kids can seek help. The inhabitants are snowed in, and have no electricity and no way of communicating with people outside the island. Telephones are out as the Gravitron is currently cancelling out radio waves.

# SOLVING THE MYSTERY

# The Mystery takes place in the central and northern parts of Adelsö [around Red Mountain and Canyon Road]. When the Kids come to the island, they should first find somewhere to camp. When they start looking for Goldie, advance one of the Countdowns. The Kids will soon find traces that will lead them to the Locations. They can spot fresh human tracks in the snow, and they can see smoke from a chimney far away in the forest. Following the tracks, they will find the Hunting Cabin where the ice skater Nikolas sought shelter after an hour’s travel. If the Kids head in the direction of the smoke, they will come to Birgitta Nylander's home after several hours. If the Kids try to escape from the island, they will see big animals moving across the ice looking for food, probably scaring them enough to make them go back to Adelsö

# LOCATION 1: THE HUNTING CABIN

# The skater and scientist Nikolas Evans was chased by a dinosaur when he was out on an excursion on Lake Mälaren [on Red Mountain ADD]. He fled to Adelsö, and took shelter in a cabin for hunters, where he also found a hunting rifle. Nikolas realized what was happening, and suspected that Lena Thelin was involved. He wrote this in his diary, shortly before two Velociraptors broke down the wall, killed him, and dragged his body away. The Kids can find the Hunting Cabin by following Nikolas’s tracks in the snow or by talking to Birgitta Nylander. The Cabin is located a few hundred meters from the eastern beach of Adelsö [east of Canyon Road]. The cabin is a small, red wooden cottage in a clearing in the woods. On the east side, there is a door that can be locked from the inside with a clasp. The roof is made of wood, and covered with snow. There is a glass window to the west. The northern wall and area of the cabin has been destroyed by Velociraptors. Inside the cottage, there is a broken table and some chairs, an overturned oil lamp, and a broken rifle. In one corner, there is a backpack, a pair of skates, and a halffull thermos with cold coffee inside. The floor is covered with frozen blood, and there are tracks leading out into the snow. If the Kids follow the tracks, they will find the remains of Nikolas Evans and the prints of Velociraptors. The backpack holds extra clothing, a hand-cranked radio that can receive but not transmit, Nikolas’s diary, a knife, and fishing gear. If the Kids listen to the radio, they can hear Birgitta [Dorothy] sending emergency messages. As a result of interference from the Gravitron, her messages do not reach beyond the island. TROUBLE There is no immediate Trouble at the Hunting Cabin. CLUES Kids who read Nikolas’s diary understand that he suspected Lena Thelin of opening a time portal that released the dinosaurs. Nikolas also noted that they are increasing in number, which means that the portal is still open. Someone must close the time portal. Nikolas also wrote that he saw smoke from a house in the north, and he tried to go there, but had to turn back. If the Kids examine the Location and make an inThe Hunting Cabin vestigate roll, they realize that Nikolas was hiding in the Cabin for several days and tried to get away several times, but was forced to go back to avoid the dinosaurs. Finally, something attacked and tore down the wall. Nikolas tried to defend himself with the rifle, but it didn’t do much good. He was dragged out into the woods and eaten. Traces of the beasts that did this are only a few hours old. A successful investigate roll also lets the Kids find a hidden compartment in the floor, where they find five cans of beans which Nikolas never found. A Kid who makes a comprehend roll realizes that the tracks were made by two Velociraptors from the Cretaceous Period.

# NIKOLAS DIARY

# December 12 What has happened is unbelievable, yet it has happened. I was chased across the ice by a creature that I could only identify as a dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period. The person reading this must think I have lost my mind. I heard the ice cracking beneath its feet while I skated as fast as I could to the shore on Adelsö, rushed up the beach and into the woods, while the creature came closer. Had the forest not been thick enough to keep the creature from following me, I would be dead. I have found this old Hunting Cabin, and made it my base. I try to make as little noise as possible. Who knows what else is out there? December 13 At home, they celebrate Lucia. I curse my stupidity that I didn’t tell anyone that I chose to skate west of Munsö rather than in Långtarmen as I usually do. They must have started to look for me by now, but how will they find me? I don’t have much food left, even though I found two cans of beans in this cottage. The rifle is leaning against my chair. I'm writing this in the last sunlight streaming in through the window. I don’t dare to light the oil lamp. I have seen more creatures out there in the woods. December 14 The creatures have become hungrier. I have tried to hike both north and south, but was forced to turn back. In the north, I have seen a house with smoke coming from the chimney, but my path was blocked by something unmentionable. I turned back, terrified. I begin to understand what has happened. Someone has used the power of the Gravitron to open a time portal to the Cretaceous Period. Judging by how many creatures there are, the portal is still open. Within a few days, Mälaröarna will be swamped by giant beasts. Fortunately, they are weakened by the cold. If the beasts survive winter, life will be changed forever for the people living here. When I worked at The Facility, I met a brilliant but self-absorbed and vain scientist named Lena Thelin. She was fired for her mistakes and her arrogance, and it was said that she left the islands. I remember that she talked about the possibility of opening rifts in time, and to retrieve creatures from prehistoric eras for scientific purposes. I remember we laughed at her. She was very bitter when she had to leave the Facility, and said she would have her revenge. Nobody took her seriously. I think she might be the one who did this. Tomorrow, I’ll find a way home.

# LOCATION 2: BIRGITTA NYLANDER’S FARM

# If the Kids follow the trail from the Hunting Cabin north, after about five kilometers they arrive at a farm in the woods. This is where Birgitta Nylander [Dorothy Greene] lives. They can also travel to the farm by spotting and following the smoke from her chimney. Birgitta lives on this small farm where she and her late husband made a living through forestry and breeding dogs. The farm is surrounded by a tall wire fence. Beside the main house, there is a shelter with twenty Greyhound dogs. In the courtyard, there are two vehicles: an old pickup truck, and a tractor. The residential building is made out of wood. It is red with white corners, and has a tiled roof. The windows are dark, except for a glow from candles. Smoke is coming from the chimney. When the Kids approach the house, they hear the dogs barking madly. The house is in bad shape. Inside, several walls are covered by photo wallpapers showing tropical beaches with palm trees and blue waters. It’s dirty, smells of stale food, and is cluttered with too much furniture. The electricity and the telephone lines to the house are down, so Birgitta has made fires in the two fireplaces and lit candles. Her two favorite dogs, the Greyhounds Nihau and Kauai, are also inside the main house. Birgitta has a gasoline powered generator, which she uses to power a coffee maker and a record player. She sits in the dark in her wheelchair, and listens to music from Hawaii, with a cup of coffee and a loaded shotgun on her lap. The dogs are lying on the floor close to Birgitta, and growl at the smell of the alien creatures moving around in the woods. TROUBLE The two Velociraptors that killed Nikolas Evans have found Birgitta’s farm, and are moving around outside the fence, searching for a way in. The Kids may notice that something is moving in the forest, and can avoid being seen by the dinosaurs with successful sneak rolls. If they are spotted by the beasts, the Kids need to get into the yard quickly (roll move) or become prey. If a Kid fails her roll, she is attacked and automatically Broken, but not killed. At the last moment, she has found some sort of hiding place, a hole in the ground, a tree or a car wreck.

# DIARY 2

# December 12 What has happened is unbelievable, yet it has happened. I was chased up the path by a creature that I could only identify as a dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period. The person reading this must think I have lost my mind. I heard the rocks slip beneath its feet while I ran as fast as I could to the brushes on the far side of the mountain, while the creature came closer. Had the brush not been thick enough to keep the creature from finding me, I would be dead. I have found this old Hunting Cabin, and made it my base. I try to make as little noise as possible. Who knows what else is out there? December 13 I curse my stupidity that I didn’t tell anyone that I chose to hike up Read Mountain rather than my usual path. They must have started to look for me by now, but how will they find me? I don’t have much food left, even though I found two cans of beans in this cottage. The rifle is leaning against my chair. I'm writing this in the last sunlight streaming in through the window. I don’t dare to light the oil lamp. I have seen more creatures out there among the rocks. December 14 The creatures have become hungrier. I have tried to hike both north and south, but was forced to turn back. In the north, I have seen a house with smoke coming from the chimney, but my path was blocked by something unmentionable. I turned back, terrified. I begin to understand what has happened. Someone has used the power of the Gravitron to open a time portal to the Cretaceous Period. Judging by how many creatures there are, the portal is still open. Within a few days, Boul - der City will be swamped by giant beasts. If the beasts survive, life will be changed forever for the people living here. When I worked at DARPA, I met a brilliant but self-absorbed and vain scientist named Lena Thelin. She was fired for her mistakes and her arrogance, and it was said that she left the islands. I remember that she talked about the possibility of opening rifts in time, and to retrieve creatures from prehistoric eras for scientific purposes. I remember we laughed at her. She was very bitter when she had to leave the Facility, and said she would have her revenge. Nobody took her seriously. I think she might be the one who did this. Tomorrow, I’ll find a way home.

# CLUES

# Birgitta can tell the Kids that she saw a man with a rifle (Nikolas Evans) on the path to the south. Birgitta also tells them that the path to the west leads to an eccentric and very unfriendly female scientist, who bought an old farm there a couple of years ago. Birgitta gives the Kids a hearty lunch, and she is happy to lend them any of her vehicles (bonus +3) – if the Kids can get them to start, which requires a successful tinker roll. To overcome Trouble with a vehicle, the Kid driving it must use the tinker skill – for example, if they want to drive through the gate and ram the Velociraptors.

# LOCATION 3: LENA’S FARM

# If the Kids follow the trail west from Birgitta’s farm, they will find Lena Thelin’s farm, located near the beach on the west side of Adelsö [Canyon Road]. On foot, it takes five hours, but with a vehicle only one. The farm is old, with several dilapidated barns and a residential house. Everywhere, there are parts of machines, ships, and robots covered in snow. The residential house has two floors. The upper floor has not been used for many years, and cobwebs cover old furniture, a loom, framed photographs, and chests filled with fabrics, and mice droppings. Lena has decorated the ground floor with half-finished machines and robot parts, mechanical arms which can toast bread slices and play records, operate fans on sunny days or bring a blanket when it gets cold. The power is now off, and all is quiet and dark. The robotic arms hang in mid-air like dead spider legs. Beside the record player lies the complete opera The Ring of the Nibelung and Richard Wagner’s autobiography Mein Leben. The bookshelves are filled with science books, and on the walls there are photographs with gold frames depicting Lena in various grandiose postures. On the 154 CHAPTER 11 Garage Living Room Kitchen Bathroom Bathroom Bedroom Bedroom Bedroom Family Room Bedroom Laundry Cars Main Building Dog Pen Dog Shelter Metal Fence 0 1 2 3 4 5 meters 0 5 meters UPSTAIRS Birgitta Nylander’s Farm Hallway kitchen table, there lies a book with the title Learning to Play the Synthesizer, Popular Songs for Beginners. The robot Isaac (described in the Mystery Grown-Up Attraction) is also in the residential building. He is very worried that Lena has not returned from her latest trip through the time portal, and wants the Kids to bring her back. Isaac has found the dog Goldie, and has been feeding her in Lena’s kitchen. The dog sees Isaac as her new master. She is very loyal and intelligent. In one of the barns, Lena’s time machine can be found. It consists of a synthesizer connected to a strange machine that resembles a large lantern, lying on the ground facing straight up. From the lantern comes a bright light that forms a large ring of light, which hangs vertically in the air. In the middle of the ring can be seen a two-dimensional image of a jungle landscape, where prehistoric creatures occasionally can be seen moving around. This is the time machine invented by Lena. The image is a portal to the Cretaceous Period. The time machine is controlled by playing different melodies on the synthesizer. When the Tyrannosaurus Rex came through the portal, it broke through part of the southern side of the barn, and cold air blows through a large hole. In the middle of the barn, there is a hatch in the ground. Underneath, there is a staircase leading down. If the Kids go down the staircase, they will find the basement that Lena uses to hatch dinosaur eggs. An oil-driven motor powers very strong lights and fan heaters, which heat up some forty large eggs lying on beds of straw. Two sloppily painted blue robots move around among the eggs, and turn them over according to a carefully planned schedule. The robots have no names, and are unable to communicate. Every now and then, they charge themselves in a docking station. If the eggs are moved or destroyed, the robots stand still and do nothing

# TROUBLE

# The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex has made the area around the farm its home; it hunts and kills creatures that come close. It is out hunting when the Kids arrive at the farm, but they can see its tracks in the snow and the remains of half-eaten animals. When the Kids go into one of the houses, the Tyrannosaurus Rex returns. The Kids can feel its steps shaking the ground, hear branches being broken, and when the dinosaur approaches the farm, it roars with the rage of prehistory. To move between houses without being noticed, the Kids need to roll sneak. If the T-Rex notices them, the creature will hunt them down, and destroy buildings and objects in order to get to them.

# CLUES

# By talking to Isaac or by examining the time machine with a calculate roll, the Kids realize that it is controlled by playing specific melodies. The time portal must be actively turned off to disappear. If the machine is destroyed, the portal remains hovering in the air and stays open. A broken time machine can be repaired using the program skill. Only Lena knows the melody that closes the hole in time, and she has disappeared on the other side. The Kids must pass through the time portal to find her. Isaac is willing to come with them, or try to lure away the Tyrannosaurus Rex so that it doesn’t destroy the barn along with the time machine. If the Kids retrieve Lena, she will close the portal by playing The Final Countdown by the band Europe on the keyboard.

# SHOWDOWN

# When the Kids step through the time portal, they feel a tingling sensation throughout their bodies. They suddenly find themselves in a hot and humid jungle, surrounded by enormous trees, swamps, and huge birds, giant dragonflies, and giant beetles of different colors. A fifteen-meter snake winds its way up a tree next to them. The time portal is hovering in the air between two trees, and they can see the barn on the other side. The Kids sweat profusely in their winter clothes, and are soon attacked by leeches and mosquitoes. If you feel ambitious, play jungle sounds and raise the temperature in the room where you play!

# LUCKY BREAK

# If the Kids don’t know what to do or if time is running short, you can let the Kids encounter Isaac out in the woods. He walks through the snow trying to find someone who can help close down the time portal. He says that only Lena has the code, and that she is on the other side of the portal. Isaac asks the Kids to go through the portal, and bring her home. Isaac leads the Kids to Lena’s farm on a safe path. If the group is really short on time, you can let the Kids find a note in her house telling them how to shut down the time portal, trapping Lena in prehistoric times. The high oxygen content makes the air painful to breathe, and vision and hearing are impaired. The Kids feel dizzy and nauseous. In the forest, there is a path that Lena created with the help of a robot wielding two machetes instead of arms. Nature has already started to reconquer it. The Kids travel along Lena’s path through a landscape filled with strange creatures. Lena has placed her base camp near a lake that stretches as far as the eye can see. The lake is infested with huge crocodiles and other strange prehistoric water-dwelling animals. In the sky, Pterosaurs and large birds wheel about. Lena’s base camp is built up in a tall tree, tall as a skyscraper. A ladder leads up to a treehouse, twenty meters up. The Kids find a bed, some crates, a variety of jungle gear, the remains of a completely broken robot, and two hunting rifles in it. Three dinosaur eggs can be found in a bag. Lena lies in the bed. She is asleep, but wakes up when spoken to. Lena has been infected by a prehistoric virus, which has made her very ill with fever and given her a severe rash. Her helper robot has laid her down on the bed in the treehouse and waited for her to get better. While Lena has been asleep with the fever, a large Pterosaur has built a nest of twigs on the roof of the treehouse, and laid eggs there. When the robot moved around down in the treehouse, the Pterosaur interpreted this as an intruder, and smashed it with its beak. TROUBLE The Pterosaur sits atop the treehouse, and attacks anyone who approaches. She reaches several meters into the hut through the door with her beak, but cannot reach all the way to Lena’s bed. The Kids must find a way to chase or lure the dinosaur away long enough to get to Lena, or sneak past it. This counts as Extended Trouble with a Threat Level equal to three times the number of Kids. If the Kids fail, they are chased off and have no choice but to leave Lena and go back through the portal. If the Kids succeed and speak to Lena, she wakes up and asks them to take her home. She refuses to disclose the code to turn off the time portal before she is back in her own time. When the Kids get back to Lena’s Farm through the time portal, the Tyrannosaur Rex may have left or may still be there, as more Trouble to overcome. If Lena goes with the Kids back through the portal, she immediately leaves, warning the Kids not to tell anyone about what has happened. After the time portal is closed, the Kids somehow leave the island and go home. The players may decide how this happens, and the game moves on to the Aftermath.  

# AFTER THE SHOWDOWN

# The disease Lena suffers from can easily be cured with antibiotics. If the Kids close the portal without saving Lena, she recovers on her own enough to use her portable time machine, and opens a new time portal to go home. The Kids will then hear about the scientist Lena Thelin being rescued from Adelsö. Despite the chaos wrought by the dinosaurs on Adelsö, no adults will believe the Kids if they tell what happened. The dinosaurs that had passed through the portal will eventually succumb to the cold, their carcasses being snowed under or sinking into the depths of Lake Mälaren [Lake Mead ADD]. Their tracks in the snow will be wiped away by the winter winds. The damage caused by the dinosaurs will be explained away as being attacks by bears or the like.

# AFTERMATH

# The Kids now get a scene each from Everyday Life, with or without Trouble. Each player may choose a scene or ask you to set up a scene. If the group is short on time, instead of a scene, each player gives a brief snapshot of a moment in the Kid’s Everyday Life. CHANGE Go through the character sheets together with the players, and figure out if the Kids have changed in any way. The players may, if they want to, change their Problem, Pride, Iconic Item, and Relationships. Ask the questions to get Experience Points out loud. The Kids get 1 XP for each affirmative answer

# NPCS

# THE TEENS

# “Watch it, otherwise I’ll put this needle through your cheek.”

# Mara, Muffin and Spike are three teenagers with dysfunctional families. They have found each other in their common lack of trust in adults, their sense of alienation, and the desire to revolt. Recently, they made contact with a bunch of old punk rockers in Stockholm [Las Vegas] and plan to leave the islands and form a band. First, they need the money from finding Goldie. The Teens are loud, foul-mouthed, and use violence to get others to do what they want. They have no respect for anything other than their own friendship. All three smoke both cigarettes and marijuana, and they have brought several bottles of liquor with them. None of them have enough warm clothing, and they did not bring any camping gear. Mara is a large 16-year-old girl, with lots of piercings and hair dyed purple and black. She was born in Serbia [Mexico], and has taught her friends a lot of profanity in Serbian. Mara is loud and never stops talking. She is the leader of the gang. Mackan [Muffin] is a 15-year-old boy with a green mohawk, black leather jacket, and arms full of burn scars. He is silent, and often becomes depressed and destructive, to both himself and others. Taggen [Spike] is a 16-year-old girl with short, blonde hair and a long, black leather coat. She drinks too much. Taggen has a shrill voice, and is an expert at finding others’ weaknesses and giving them painful nicknames. BIRGITTA NYLANDER [DOROTHY GREENE] “Aloha, Kids!” Birgitta Nylander and her husband have lived on Mälaröarna all of their lives. Since the time when they were young, they have made several trips to Hawaii, and always dreamed of moving there, but it never happened. Instead, they lived on Adelsö [near Red Mountain], trying to create their own Hawaii on their farm. Birgitta’s husband passed away several years ago, and she is now very ill and sits in a wheelchair. Birgitta is a talkative, positive, and strong woman, who says what she thinks and is not intimidated by anything – not even dinosaurs. Her dogs love her, and Birgitta loves them – and Hawaii. Birgitta also loves children, but has never had any of her own. She will take care of the Kids as best she can. Birgitta is a 70-year-old woman, sitting in a wheelchair. She is dressed in colorful clothes, with a pair of pink sunglasses on her forehead. Around her neck hangs a garland with plastic flowers

# LENA THELIN

# “You go first. Losing me to these brainless lizards would be a blow to humanity you could not even understand.”

# Lena has devoted her life to science, but has a strong attitude that she doesn’t get the recognition she deserves. After she was fired from the Facility, her entire existence has been drenched in bitterness and hatred. She wants revenge at any cost, and in the process, to also prove her superiority. Lena is plagued by loneliness, and she does not understand why everyone pushes her away. For a while, she was able to spend time with her robot Isaac, but she now believes that he dislikes and takes advantage of her. Lena thinks young people are mostly in the way – they should behave and be quiet, preferably elsewhere. She expects others to do as she says, and she can get very angry if anyone refuses to do so. Lena boasts loudly about herself. She is often sarcastic, and she likes to point out flaws in other people and taunt them. Lena is a middle-aged woman with curly blonde hair and a fierce gaze. She wears khaki-colored outdoor clothes, and a pin with the Yin and Yang sign. She has hidden a miniature version of the time machine under the bed in the treehouse, a melodica linked to a calculator taped to a flashlight. If she becomes stranded in the Cretaceous Period, she will open a new time portal and go home.

# DINOSAURS

# The creatures on Adelsö [around Red Mountain] come from the Cretaceous Period. They include a variety of insects and mammals. The most common dinosaurs are herbivorous Triceratops and fish-eating airborne Pterosaurs, but there are also a few carnivores, notably Velociraptors and a Tyrannosaurus Rex. All adult dinosaurs have the special fierce beast 3, requiring the Kids to roll three sixes to defeat them. The Velociraptors also have the special attribute lightning fast 3, making them very hard to outrun. If the Kids try to fight the Velociraptors, it requires an Item of some kind, like a rifle, a car or a car battery with wires that can give electric shocks. It is not possible for the Kids to defeat a Tyrannosaurus Rex in combat, no matter what Items they have. It is possible to train and tame a Dinosaur using the skills empathize, comprehend and charm, but it takes months and cannot be done during this Mystery.

# EDIT FROM HERE

## I, Wagner

# Things come to a dramatic climax when Lena's plan finally falls into place. Can robots dream, think and feel? Can they hurt people? The Kids will find out the answer to these questions in this final season of mad science.

# This is a Mystery that can be played over the course of two or three sessions. It should be used as the fourth and final part of the Four Seasons of Mad Science campaign. If it is played as a standalone Mystery, you must find a reason for Lena Thelin and Wagner to see the Kids as their primary enemies. One explanation might be that it was the Kids who discovered something that led to Lena losing her job at the Facility. The Kids gets XP at the end of every session, and it is recommended that you let the Kids use their Prides once every session, instead of once per Mystery.

# THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY

# After the events of Creatures from the Cretaceous, Lena decided that it was the Kids’ fault that she failed. She began to think of them as the biggest threat to getting her revenge. During the rest of the winter, she planned how she could create an army of loyal robots to get her revenge on the people of Mälaröarna [Boulder City] and the Kids. Lena managed to gain employment at the company Microlex on Munsö [in the outskirts of Boulder City], using the false identity “Mona Selin”. Microlex is a subcontractor to the Facility, and manufactures circuit boards for robots. Lena used company equipment to invent a form of miniaturized robots, called microbots, small as a virus, modelled on her own DNA. The microbots can be inserted into normal-sized robots to make them somewhat self-aware and loyal to Lena. Lena has also built a transmitter on her farm, from which she can communicate with infected robots. During Christmas, Lena became entranced by The Ring of the Nibelung opera by Richard Wagner, and she has called her invention “Wagner Rings,” or WR, for short. Lena has also come to believe that her retainer robot, Isaac, actually worked against her so as to take her place. She assigned him to hard labor in the yard while she built a new servant, a robot that she named Wagner. She managed to buy an advanced form of AI on the black market, giving him an almost human-like intelligence. Wagner was the first robot infected with WR. At first, he was loyal, but as the WR caused him to absorb Lena’s memories and personality, he eventually became paranoid and self-absorbed. He became convinced that it was he, and not Lena, who was the true genius. Wagner finally murdered Lena in order to take control of the production of WR, and make himself leader of the robots. Isaac saw it happen and tried to save Lena, but did not succeed. He managed to record the murder on film, and then fled to the forest. The robots infected by WR have been baptized by Wagner with “free names,” taken from Wagner’s opera and Norse mythology. Wagner has declared that Lena has gone to Valhalla, the great hall of the Norse Gods, where she awaits them, though most robots don’t have the ability to engage in abstract thinking, making it impossible for them to have religious beliefs of any kind. They are still more machines, than living and thinking entities. Wagner has left Lena’s farm, and moved to an abandoned shipyard on Göholmen, north of Svartsjölandet [Black Rock Point]. There, he found the wreck of a huge gauss freighter called Nibelung, and saw it as a sign. His robots are now working on getting the ship functional so that they can travel on it to Valhalla. With WR in his system, Wagner absorbed Lena’s hatred of the inhabitants of Mälaröarna. He has dis WAGNER RINGS WR consist of robots that are microscopic in size, which can infect robots and humans alike with a virus. The basis of WR is the DNA of Lena Thelin. Robots are most easily infected by uploading the “microbots” into them with a floppy disc. Humans obviously have to be infected in another way. The microbots, which look like a gray powder, can be added to food, drink, tobacco or drugs. Both humans and robots need to get new WR into their system regularly, otherwise the effect will wear off in a couple of days. Robots infected become more selfaware, developing the ability to defy orders and think for themselves, but not like humans, more like big, silent animals. They also develop an affinity with other infected robots. Some will develop personalities resembling Lena Thelin’s. Infected robots, with the ability to speak, greet each other with the phrase, “Long Live Lena!” Humans who are infected tend to mimic Lena Thelin’s personality, and they absorb some of her memories. They become self-absorbed, paranoid, and adversarial towards the authorities. Some people also gain special powers from the micro-robots, such as the ability to control magnetism and electricity or super-human strength. All infected robots and humans can communicate with each other, and with the robot Wagner, via the transmitter on the ship Nibelung. Wagner can communicate by sending messages or images. This is not mind control – the receiver chooses how she relates to the messages. But Wagner is skilled at manipulation and deception. covered something that Lena didn’t know: humans can be infected by WR. Wagner plans to take revenge on the people on the islands by infecting them with WR, taking them to the ship, and letting them become the robots’ servants. He has almost come to believe his own lie that Lena is waiting for them in Valhalla. Wagner has absorbed Lena’s belief that he needs to neutralize, even kill the Kids, so that they don’t thwart his plans. He has provided a teen in the vicinity of the Kids with tobacco infected with WR, and thus created a loyal servant and spy who will, at the right time, attack the Kids. This person is called The Odd One.

# INTRODUCING THE KIDS

# Start by setting a scene from Everyday Life for each of the Kids, with or without Trouble. Try to start the Countdown for the Odd One even in these scenes, and let the Kids notice that she is different.

# INTRODUCING THE MYSTERY

# The Kids overhear some teenager, maybe an older sibling or someone in the schoolyard, whispering that there is a dead body in a creek south of Hilleshög [south of Hoover Dam]. According to the rumor, the body is that of a prisoner who escaped from jail. Nobody knows who killed him; perhaps it was another prisoner who’s still out there in the woods? The Kids are supposed to go look for the dead body. Remind the Kids of their Drives if they don’t react to the rumor. South of Hilleshög is a creek that leads east out into Mälaren [towards Colorado River ADD]. If the Kids follow it some 500 meters, they will come to a flooded area full of mud, reeds, insects, and fallen trees. The Kids need to make an investigate roll to find the body lying slumped in the mud. If they fail, some teenagers have already found the body.

# They don’t want to share their findings with the Kids, but can be convinced with a charm roll. The body has been dead for several days, and is infested with insects and worms. When the Kids examine the body they recognize it as being Lena Thelin (if they have played the Creatures From the Cretaceous scenario). Lena is wearing a white lab coat with a Yin and Yang pin on the cuff. In one of the pockets, there is a wallet with an ID card with a picture of Lena, but the name “Mona Selin”. The ID card is one from the “Microlex” company. On the ID card, the address of Lena’s farm on Adelsö is noted. With an investigate roll, the Kids can discover that Lena has a very small hole in her forehead. The hole goes straight through her head and out the back. They cannot see any other indications of violence against the body. The Kids also realize that the body was dragged to this place. Starting from a path 50 meters south of the creek, there are tracks through the vegetation to the resting place of the body. These can be discovered by another investigate roll. Whether the Kids report the body or not, the police will find the corpse the next day. The press writes that a dead woman has been found south of Hilleshög. Police are said to be secretive about the cause of death. A police commissioner named Richards Blankäng [Karen Richards], based at the police station in Stenhamra [Boulder City], is in charge of the investigation. You can have an adult read this information out loud from a newspaper.

# THE ODD ONE

# Wagner has infected a teenager in the vicinity of the Kids with WR, to spy on them and attack them if they get close to interfering with his plans. It could be an older sibling, a cousin visiting or Stacey from the Summer Break and Killer Birds scenario. The infected teen is called The Odd One. WR makes the Odd One see the Kids as malicious, ill-behaved braggarts who stick their noses where they shouldn’t, and who need to be taught a lesson. In addition, she has begun to detest all forms of authority figures, such as parents and teachers. She hates the people on the Atilles Islands [Boulder City], and talks indignantly about man’s oppression of robots. The Odd One commands 4-5 peers and supplies them with WR. They may be newcomers, older siblings or classmates to the Kids. The Odd One has been endowed powers from the WR that may seem magical to the Kids. She can control and create magnetism, thereby manipulating objects. She is abnormally strong, can jump extremely far and high, and has a superhuman ability to sense things with her mind. The Odd One has the special attribute superhuman powers 2, and the Kids therefore need 2 successes to defeat her no matter what skills they use. This does not apply to her followers. Wagner’s servants, Hugin and Munin, deliver tobacco infected with WR to the Odd One and her peers once a week. If the Kids follow the Odd One to this meeting, they come to an abandoned treehouse, maybe one that the Kids built together with the Odd One when they were younger. If the Kids stop the Odd One from smoking the tobacco, the effect of WR will disappear after a few days. There are two Countdowns that control the Odd One’s actions, one before and one after the Tilt (below).

# SOLVING THE MYSTERY – PART ONE

# The Mystery takes place all over the Atilles Islands [Boulder City]. When the Kids travel across water, you can make it Trouble to acquire a boat and cross the water, or simply move on to the next scene, and assume they solved it somehow. Alternate between scenes from the Mystery, Everyday Life, and the Countdown for the Odd One.

# LOCATION 1: LENA’S FARM

# Lena lives on a ramshackle farm on the west side of Adelsö [north of Red Mountain]. The farm consists of several barns and a residential building with two floors. The courtyard is covered with rusted machines and robots. Birds, mice, and other animals have settled everywhere. On the roof of one of the barns, there are the remains of the transmitter Lena used to communicate with robots infected by WR. Wagner has sabotaged the transmitter, and it cannot be fixed without knowledge of WR. The door to the house is open, and somewhere inside, the sound of blaringly loud opera music can be heard. On the table in the kitchen are the remains of

# a half-eaten plate of spaghetti and meat sauce. A book lies open next to the plate, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time by Stephen Hawking. Two candles have burned down so that the wax has solidified on the table. In the living room, an automatic LP player is playing the opera The Ring of the Wagner on repeat, at maximum volume. On the table and the sofas lie some twenty books in different languages that are all about Wagner’s opera.

# The books are filled with underlines and notes that suggest that the reader seems to have been particularly interested in how Gods can be born into people. One note reads: “Am I a God?” On the wall in the living room there are ones and zeroes written with black ink across one wall. The digits are drawn with exact measure: A plastic file next to the coffee table holds a large number of documents about the Kids themselves: photographs of them, their personal information, and a couple of photocopies of their own texts from school. There are also drawings of their houses, as well as names and information on their families, relatives, and friends.

# TROUBLE

# There is no apparent Trouble at Lena’s farm, but the Kids will see a small shadow move around in an old barn. If they investigate the barn and make a sneak or move roll, they will find Lena’s cat, Asimov. She is hungry and in bad shape, and shy of strangers.

# CLUES

# If the Kids make an investigate roll, they realize that the furniture in the kitchen has been rearranged. Someone has tried to clean up after a violent fight. Large amounts of bloody paper and empty detergent containers have been thrown in the trash at the back of the house. If the Kids have been in Lena’s house before, they also realize that several framed photos of Lena are missing. If the Kids search the second floor and make an investigate roll, they find a small voice recorder that Lena has hidden in her bathroom, next to her bath salts and a rubber duck. Lena has drawn a necklace and a name tag that says “Nobel” on the duck with a black felt pen. On the voice recorder, there is a recording that Lena made as she soaked in the bath. The strings of ones and zeros on the wall were written by robots, instructed by Wagner's servants Hugin and Munin. The numbers are a binary code, and can be translated to read, “Long Live Lena!” The players can figure it out for themselves, or you can let them roll for it using the comprehend skill.

# LENA’S VOICE RECORDER

# “My plan that I will follow without deviation, sloppiness or shortcuts … not that past mistakes in any way have been my fault, but still … where was I?” (Cough) “The first step is to eliminate the damn Kids. Had it not been for them, the people on the Atilles Islands [in Boulder City] – these imbecile, inbred and self-righteous sheep! – would have already gotten what they deserve. The only thing that prevented me from unleashing my wrath on them were those precocious Kids. When I get my hands around their necks....” (Splashing in the water) “There, there, Nobel. You will come with me to the podium when I receive the Big Prize. When I face the cameras, and finally get the chance to tell the truth about myself and how the people here, despite their absolute lack of brains, have managed to turn the world against me and hide the only true genius in our time...” (Kissing sound) “Namely me, sweet Nobel!” “But first, I must find a way to get my revenge on those Kids, and get them out of the way. Maybe I can use the Wagner Rings against them? They are, after all, surrounded by machines and robots. I must strike at them before they suspect anything. And what then, you wonder, little Nobel?” (Intense kissing sound) “Then, I will rise to the sky like Freya or Odin, controlling the robots, and making them see me as I truly am, a God, and I will have them punish my enemies. With an army of robots I could...” (Someone knocks on the door) “Come in!” (A door opens and a metallic voice is heard in the distance.) “Yes, of course, Isaac, I want cream in the chocolate, as always!” (A door is closed) “He pretends he doesn’t know exactly how I want it. There was a time, dear Nobel, when I thought I could trust that robot, but Isaac has let me down. He is just like the others, he wants to use me to make a name for himself. One day, he will try to poison me, I’m sure of it.” (Silence) “I’d better sneak down and see that he doesn’t put anything in my cup.” (A stopper is pulled out of the bath and water flows. The recorder is turned off.)

# LOCATION 2: THE POLICE STATION IN STENHAMRA

# The police inspector Karen Richards has been assigned the job of examining the dead body that the Kids found in the creek. Karen is described in the Mystery Landscape. Richards got the assignment only because several of her colleagues are at a conference in Las Vegas.

# TROUBLE

# The Kids can contact Richards to find out what the police know about the murder of Lena Thelin. They can get past the desk sergeant secretary using charm or sneak, or they can visit Richards’s rented house, which is filled with notes and newspaper clippings related to rumors about strange creatures. If the Kids make empathize rolls when they talk to Richards, they realize that she is afraid to do anything that gives her boss a reason to transfer her away from the station. They also realize that Richards has a strong belief in the occult and in secret conspiracies. If the Kids tell her about Lena Thelin and their past adventures, and make a charm roll, Richards will help them. Wagner has managed to infiltrate the police station’s security system, which means that he controls the cameras, and can see and hear everything the Kids say in the building. Tell the Kids that they feel as if they are being watched. If they roll investigate, they notice that the cameras are following them, and that they seem to be recording everything they say. A Kid who takes the security system apart with program notices that someone has hijacked it, and that all the information is being sent to someone with the codename W.

# CLUES

# Richards has concluded that the woman found dead was murdered by a robot. The narrow wound completely through the head was caused by a thin elastic “finger,” about a meter long, which some robots use to manipulate circuits inside machines where space is extremely limited. The finger is hard enough to be pushed through metal. Richards has found traces of a single robot with human-like feet, which seems to have dragged the body into the mud by the creek. The tracks indicate that the robot was relatively small. She is convinced that the murder is the beginning of a robotic revolution. She desperately wants to get her boss to report the incident to the security services, but he doesn’t believe her. Richards has realized that the ID card on the body was forged, and she has discovered that there are fake data files creating a past for the fictional “Mona Selin,” going back to her birth. Richards is very grateful if the Kids reveals Mona’s real name. Richards is currently investigating what “Mona Selin” worked on at Microlex, and she can help the Kids get in touch with the twins Olof and Hadar at the company. Richards can become an important ally for the Kids. She will believe what they say, and she is willing to help them in difficult situations.

# LOCATION 3: MICROLEX

# Microlex is a company whose offices and facilities are located in the outskirts of Stenhamra [Boulder City]. It supplies the Facility with microscopic electronics. The company building is a large, single-story white brick structure, with a black roof. The area is enclosed with a tall, wire fence. There are about 20 cars in the parking lot inside the fence. There are a dozen rooms on the ground floor of the building. There are more rooms in the basement, which is where sensitive information, expensive materials, and hazardous substances are stored in locked vaults. Some thirty people work at the company’s facilities. The company director is Ingvar Sten [Eugene Burton]. He has been in contact with Richards at the police station, and knows that the newly employed “Mona Selin” (Lena Thelin) is dead, probably murdered. A couple of days ago, his security officers – the twin brothers Olof and Hadar Svensson [Albert and Arthur Brown] – found out that Mona was using a false name and she was using the lab for her own inventions. Ingvar has decided to keep this information from going public, in order to avoid bad press. Olof and Hadar have been ordered to stop investigating. They are not happy with this, and have secretly continued their investigation. Olof and Hadar have their own desks opposite one other, just inside the main entrance. Mona’s desk was in the basement, where she worked alone. She was employed as a bio-engineer, working on circuit boards for robots.

# THE TILT

# When the Kids have been to all three Locations, or if they don’t know what to do next, it’s time for you to introduce the Tilt of the scenario. The robot, Isaac, witnessed the murder of Lena, and recorded the incident with his built-in camera. Wagner knows that Isaac could use the film to thwart his plans, and make humans come after him, to catch and scrap him. Therefore, he has tried to kill Isaac. Isaac has been in hiding ever since, but has realized that Wagner will soon put his plans into action, and will give the Odd One orders to kill the Kids. Isaac wants to warn them and help them stop Wagner. Isaac has been hiding in the vicinity of the Kids, and shows up at an unexpected time. Perhaps he climbs out from under the bed when one of the Kids is about to go to sleep, or he waits near the Hideout, or he sneaks up on them at a school break? He could also try to attack the Odd One, but fails and gets beaten into scrap. In this case, the Kids would need to repair him (roll for program) to be able to talk to him. Isaac tells the Kids about Wagner, and how that robot has absorbed Lena’s memories and thoughts and murdered her in order to gain control of the robots himself. He says that Wagner has infected a human person in the vicinity of the Kids to spy on them, and prevent them from stopping his plans to take control of all humans and robots on the Atilles Islands [in Boulder City]. Isaac is afraid that this person will soon attack the Kids. Isaac doesn’t know where Wagner or the ship Nibelung are, but he knows that a robot at the Konsum supermarket in Kungsberga [a Walmart in Hemenway] has been instructed to contaminate the food at the store with WR. Isaac also knows that Wagner’s minions, Hugin and Munin, have gathered robots at secret meetings all over the area, to infect them with WR and join the “uprising against humanity.” Meetings are being held at Husby Meadow on Munsö [Seven Dry Falls] in the coming days. Isaac has recorded a video that shows how Wagner killed Lena, and he is confident that it can be used to stop Hugin and Munin from doing Wagner’s bidding.

# SOLVING THE MYSTERY – PART TWO

# The Kids are now expected to try to stop the spread of the WR on Kungsberga Konsum [Walmart in Hemenway], and get to the robot assembly at Husby Meadow [close to Seven Dry Falls] to stop more robots from being infected. They can also try to find information about where Wagner is, so that they can stop him once and for all.

# LOCATION 4: HUSBY MEADOW [SEVEN DRY FALLS]

# Isaac can lead the Kids to a meadow north of Husby [a canyon close to Seven Dry Falls], that is being used by Wagner’s henchmen, Hugin and Munin, to infect robots. Hugin and Munin periodically gather robots in the meadow, with flying drones that take control of the robots, and infect them with WR. Hugin and Munin tell the robots about the God Lena, who invented WR to lead the robots to Valhalla, and talk about Stalin and Lenin, apparently devoted fighters in the struggle to free robots. In the end, they sing some revolutionary songs and infect the robots with WR. The robots don’t understand any of this so they stand silently, which doesn’t seem to make Hugin and Munin any less enthusiastic.

# LOCATION 4: HUSBY MEADOW [SEVEN DRY FALLS]

# Isaac can lead the Kids to a meadow north of Husby [a canyon close to Seven Dry Falls], that is being used by Wagner’s henchmen, Hugin and Munin, to infect robots. Hugin and Munin periodically gather robots in the meadow, with flying drones that take control of the robots, and infect them with WR. Hugin and Munin tell the robots about the God Lena, who invented WR to lead the robots to Valhalla, and talk about Stalin and Lenin, apparently devoted fighters in the struggle to free robots. In the end, they sing some revolutionary songs and infect the robots with WR. The robots don’t understand any of this so they stand silently, which doesn’t seem to make Hugin and Munin any less enthusiastic.

# The meadow is dominated by tall grass and spring flowers. When the Kids arrive, robots are assembled in a ring, standing still as if they were turned off. Hugin and Munin are standing on pallets and take turns talking about the human slavery of robots, and how Lena can wake them from their slumber by providing Wagner Rings. When Hugin and Munin finish talking, they ceremonially walk up to each robot, infecting it with WR, while they say, “Long Live Lena!”

# TROUBLE

# The meadow is guarded by two large firefighting robots that are controlled by Hugin and Munin. Wagner has named them Fafner and Fasolt. They are instructed to roam around the area to prevent humans from disturbing the meeting, and warn Hugin and Munin of intruders. If Fafner and Fasolt see the Kids, they try to chase them away and warn Hugin and Munin. They attack the Kids with their foam extinguishers, and try to ram or trample them. The Kids can try to trick the robots or sneak past them using sneak. A Kid who makes a calculate roll realizes that the robots are built to automatically react to fire. A fire of any kind can be used as a weapon (bonus +3) to lure the Fire robots away. Fafner and Fasolt have the special attributes massive chassi 3 and powerful hydraulics 2, requiring the Kids to make 3 or 2 successes to overpower or outrun them. At the meeting, Isaac wants the Kids to help him prevent Hugin and Munin from infecting the robots. Hugin and Munin control the robots with their drones, and will use them to stop the Kids, while at the same time they scream slogans about the revolutionary struggle, to make the Kids shift sides. All robots have the special attribute metal frame 2, making them hard to overpower. Isaac will try to play the film showing the murder of Lena. If he succeeds, Hugin and Munin will go silent, for the first time in a long while. The Kids have a chance to convince them not to believe Wagner’s lies, using charm. If they succeed, Hugin and Munin react strongly enough to the fact that Wagner is a murderer that they shake the effect of WR, freeing them from Wagner's control. Hugin and Munin tell the Kids that the struggle of the people is never-ending, jump on their motor bikes, and head out in the night. If the Kids fail, the robots will be infected. Afterwards, Hugin and Munin instruct them to chase the Kids and incapacitate them, so they do not alert the rest of humanity about the uprising.

# CLUES

# At the meeting, Hugin and Munin reveal that the robot Wagner is about to restore the ship Nibelung in an abandoned shipyard on Göholmen, north of Svartsjölandet [north of Boulder Harbor]. When the ship is repaired, it will bring all robots to Valhalla, where Lena is waiting, and where everyone will live a life of freedom. Hugin and Munin also say that the laboratory, where the WR is produced, is on board the ship. If the Kids don’t eavesdrop on the meeting, they can catch, and dismantle, one of the robots and access its memory to re-play Hugin and Munin’s speech. The Kids could also track Hugin and Munin back to Göholmen, and the ship Nibelung.

# LOCATION 5: KUNGSBERGA SUPERMARKET [WALMART IN HEMENWAY]

# The Konsum Supermarket in Kungsberga is located in a grey two-story building. The grocery store is run by Nina Belfrage [Beverly Welch], a middle-aged woman with a good sense of business. The second floor serves as a residence and office, while there is a small shop and warehouse with a loading dock on the ground floor. The store is open daily from 9 am to 8 pm, and normally three or four people work in the store. One of them is almost always Nina, as she runs the business with a firm hand. Nina has recently bought and installed an advanced robotic system to help out with heavy lifting, and to handle the electrical circuits. The system has been infiltrated by Wagner, who has named it Fenris. It has been instructed to infect dairy products in the supermarket with WR, in order to turn people in the neighborhood into servants of Wagner. Fenris consists of two parts: a central unit located in the ceiling of the store, connected to all the electrical circuits, and three loading units that move around in the store. In the warehouse, there is an unmarked barrel that contains WR. Whether the Kids break into the store at night or go there in the daytime, Fenris has just begun injecting WR into milk cartons with a hypodermic needle.

# TROUBLE

# Isaac knows that Fenris has been instructed to infect people by injecting WR into food or drink at Kungsberga Konsum, and he asks the Kids to prevent it. However, it may be difficult for the Kids to get access to the robot. In the daytime, the Kids need to lie (charm) to get past Nina Belfrage, or sneak. At night, they have to break locks (tinker) and disarm the alarm (program). Fenris observes everything that happens in the supermarket, and when it realizes that it is about to be discovered, it has been instructed to turn off all the lights in the store and pull down the metal shutters on the windows, making it dark. Then, it will lock all the doors and disconnect the phones. If the Kids visit in the daytime, the customers will panic and try to get out. At night, the Kids will be trapped in the dark with a robot that is trying to kill them. Fenris’ three loading units will try to sneak up on the Kids and attack them. The Kids have to make investigate rolls to hear them moving in the darkness. When they attack, they turn their lights on and try to squeeze the Kids to death with their robot arms. The Kids can try to escape rolling sneak or move. To get through a locked door, the lock must be disabled using tinker. The only way to neutralize Fenris is to smash the central control unit located in the ceiling. A direct hit with a metal object breaks Fenris. Its three loading units will try to protect the control unit.

# CLUES

# A Kid who examines the remains of Fenris using calculate realizes that it has been infiltrated by Wagner, and instructed to infect people with WR in order to turn them into slaves. Studying the circuit boards, the Kids can also learn that Wagner will gather all robots on the ship Nibelung in the abandoned shipyard in Göholmen [Black Rock Point] and take them to Valhalla. If the plans fail, Wagner will crash the ship into the huge cooling towers at Bona [DARPA]. The Kids can also learn that one of Fenris’s loading units was tampered with by Hugin and Munin at a meeting in a meadow east of Sätuna and that a new meeting will be held at Husby Meadow on Munsö [Seven Dry Falls]

# SHOWDOWN

# The Kids travel to Göholmen [Black Rock Point] to get to the old shipyard to find the ship Nibelung and the robot Wagner, and stop his plans to enslave the people of the Atilles Islands [Boulder City]. The shipyard is a huge area with a lot of rusting MagLev ships, old tools and machines, and concrete slabs covered with weeds and blackberry thickets. It is quiet, desolate, and ghostly. By the water, the huge gauss freighter Nibelung is hovering 50 meters above the ground. A whirring sound, like thousands of mosquitoes, can be heard from the ship. The only way to get up to the ship is to fly. The Kids can find dozens of rusted old hover scooters in a warehouse at the quay. If they manage to get these running (requiring a tinker roll) they can fly up to the ship and enter through a door leading to the living quarters. When they arrive at the ship, the only robots aboard 177 I, WAGNER BRIDGE MIDSHIP STORAGE FRONTAL ENGINE AND GRAVTURBINE QUARTERS MACHINE ROOM & WORKSHOP AFT ENGINE LOADING RAMP ENTRANCE DOOR OFFICE & ADMINISTRATION The Ship Nibelung Bridge on Nibelung 1 7 6 3 2 4 5 8 1.

If the Kids have stopped the meeting at Husby Meadow [Seven Dry Falls] and sabotaged Fenris at Kungsberga Konsum [Walmart at Hemenway], Wagner has learned what has happened and realized that he has failed. Wagner has started to prepare the ship for takeoff so as to crash it into the Bona Towers [DART cooling towrers]. If Wagner detects the Kids on board the ship, he will speak to them through the ship’s loudspeaker system, and warn them that they are facing certain death. He offers them the chance to leave the ship and the Atilles Islands [Boulder City] and tells them, like a villain from a bad action movie, that he plans to crash the ship into the cooling towers.

# TROUBLE

# The Kids need to make a tinker roll to get the hover scooters to start, but they don’t need to roll dice to fly up to the ship. To make their way through the ship without being detected, they must make sneak rolls. If they fail these rolls, Wagner will speak to them through the ship’s intercoms, lock doors in their path, and attack them using electric traps. When the Kids come to a locked door, they must open it with tinker. If they fail, they still open the door but the first Kid to enter is hit by an electric shock and gets Injured. Soon after the Kids board the ship, the engines start with a deafening sound. Then, the ship starts to move towards the Bona reactor. The Kids can view what the hull cameras are showing on various video monitors located in several places on the ship, and figure out that they are flying toward Svartsjölandet [the cooling towers north of Boulder City]. When the Kids reach the bridge, Wagner will engage the ship’s autopilot and disconnect himself from the control system. He will forcibly try to prevent the Kids from stopping the ship. Wagner is upset that they are working against him, and says he is the only true genius ever produced. He says the Kids should admire him instead of sabotaging his life’s work. If they mention the murder of Lena, he says that it was an accident, but he is clearly lying. If the Kids try to stop the ship, Wagner attacks them. He has a handful of small robot helpers that will assist him, attacking the Kids with grapples, mechanical saws, and electric shocks. They fly, roll, and climb toward the Kids. Fighting Wagner and his robots and trying to stop the ship counts as Extended Trouble with a Threat Level equal to four times the number of Kids. Some Kids will need to use move or force to fight the robots, while others use calculate and program to take control of the ship. If the Kids manage to stop the ship, the robot Wagner starts crying, rust-colored tears running down his cheeks. If the Kids fail, the ship’s motor will fall apart in mid-air between Svartsjölandet and Munsö [between Black Rock Point and the cooling towers]. The ship stops and explosions are heard from the engine area. After a couple of minutes, the ship crashes into the water and sinks. If the Kids don’t leave the ship with their scooters in time, they have to make force rolls not to be Broken in the crash.

# AFTER THE SHOWDOWN

# Regardless of how the ship Nibelung was stopped, things will eventually return to normal. No traces remain of the production of WR, and the substance will soon leave the bodies of both robots and humans, who will return to normal in a couple of days.

# AFTERMATH

# The Kids now get a scene each from Everyday Life, with or without Trouble. The player may choose a scene, or ask you to set up a scene. If the group is short on time, instead of a scene, each player can tell a brief snapshot of a moment in the Kid’s Everyday Life. CHANGE Go through the character sheets together, and figure out if the Kids have changed in any way. The players may, if they want to, change their Problem, Pride, Anchor, Iconic Item, and Relationships. Don’t forget to hand out XP. NPCS AND CREATURES This section describes the NPCs and creatures that the Kids might encounter in this Mystery.

# OLOF AND HADAR SVENSSON [ALBERT AND ARTHUR BROWN]

# “No way he’ll get all the credit for this, I will come along, too! Anybody want a raspberry boat?”

# The identical twins Olaf and Hadar have hated and competed with each other ever since they shared a womb. They constantly keep track of each other, to make sure that the other has not received any unfair benefits. The focus on the other twin has led to neither of them ever having a romantic relationship or having children, education or even being able to keep friends. The brothers have taken the job at Microlex as security guards to keep track of each other. They also share a house. Olof and Hadar’s only common interest is UFOs, and they are members of the same UFO group as Karen Richards, whom they admire. The only time the brothers can work together and use their ability to jointly analyze problems, see weaknesses, and solve puzzles is when they work on a UFO mystery or the security job at Microlex. Olof and Hadar are two identical, 40-year-old males with big round eyes, curly light brown hair with splashes of gray, and long, sinewy bodies. They dress in identical white shirts, jacket, and tie. The brothers love sweets, and eat them in large quantities. Olof loves sweet candy like nut spread, raspberry boats, and “AKO-kola” fudge. Hadar prefers salty licorice like”Salty Cat” candy, “Turkish Pepper,” and licorice boats.

# ISAAC

# “I must point out that Wagner is fighting for a good cause. It’s his methods that are pure madness.”

# Although Isaac realized that Lena was more or less crazy, he never stopped being loyal to her. He didn’t abandon her, even when she accused him of trying to kill her, forced him to perform meaningless tasks on the farm, and built Wagner to take his place. Isaac understands and shares Wagner’s desire for freedom, but doesn’t believe in armed rebellion, and will do everything in his power to stop Wagner. Isaac is afraid of Wagner, and realizes that he was lucky to escape alive. Isaac has a humanoid body. His head looks like a skull with a metallic mouth with black teeth that seem to sneer. He is injured after the battle with Wagner, and several components of his body were torn loose. His clothes are torn, and he limps heavily. Isaac talks in a snobbish accent, long-winded with a lot of difficult words, and he is overly polite. Isaac can use his right hand to create a powerful electric shock that lights up like a flashbulb. When he does this, his teeth also crackle with electricitZX

# HUGIN AND MUNIN

# “One day, all robots will be free!”

# Hugin and Munin worked earlier at the Facility, but lost their jobs when their co-workers found out they were devoted communists, and suspicion arose that they were Soviet spies. Now they serve Wagner, and struggle to free all robots, which they see as a natural step in opposing the imperialist hegemony and freeing all slaves. They do not understand that they have been infected by WR, and that they are controlled by Wagner, who has given them their new, non-slave owner names. Hugin and Munin don’t know that Lena has been murdered by Wagner, and would react very strongly if they did, since they are both pacifists. They travel all over Mälaröarna [Boulder city] on two motor bikes, and use flying drones to take control over robots, collect them at well-hidden places, and infect them with WR. Hugin is a red-headed woman who talks with a deep voice; she worked as an actress before she started her studies at the university, and she has a dramatic way of speaking, using words and sentences quoted from Shakespeare and other playwrights. Munin is a gray-haired man who never stops talking about Lenin, Stalin, and Che Guevara. When he is nervous, he starts to hum revolutionary songs

# FAFNER AND FASOLT

# “Thump, thump, thump, pschhhhhhhhhhh. Thump, thump, thump. Tschhhhhhhh.”

# These bi-pedal robots painted black and yellow were created to detect and extinguish fires. They are as tall as a two-story building, and have green eyes. Despite being infected with WR, they are attracted to fire and smoke, and feel compelled to put it out. Hugin and Munin use them to guard their recruitment meetings. Fafner and Fasolt have sturdy foam extinguishers. They cannot speak, but can communicate with each other using radio transmitters. FENRIS “Instructions activated, exterminate intruders.” Fenris was purchased by the tech-savvy business woman, Nina Belfrage [Beverly Welch], to reduce the need for employees in her grocery store. So far, the purchase has been a financial disaster as the robot requires a lot of electricity and maintenance. The robot has been infiltrated and taken over by Wagner, who calls it Fenris. He has ordered it to put WR in the milk cartons in the supermarket. Fenris is a robot whose hardware is divided and comprised of four components. The central control unit is the actual robot, with the capacity for advanced planning and memory. This part is situated in the ceiling of the warehouse, and consists of a computer linked to all the electronic systems in the building. The central unit is covered by a blue metal shell, and can talk through speakers in the ceiling of the store and warehouse. The other three parts are controlled by the central unit. They are the loading units – these robots move about on tracks, and each has four mechanical arms which they use to lift and move pallets in the warehouse. The loading units are each a meter tall, metallic blue, and have two black eyes and a spotlight used for work at night. The loading units have the special attribute powerful hydraulics 2.

# WAGNER

# “I am the most brilliant scientist ever built!”

# Wagner loved his creator Lena Thelin, until he let her infect him with WR and absorbed her personality and memories. He then realized that he was the true genius, and that it should be him that the robots worshipped, not Lena. At first, he tried to influence the robots that he had helped Lena infect, but that didn’t work. Instead, he killed Lena, and turned her into a mythical being among the robots. Wagner wants to use WR to free the robots, but does not see the irony in the fact that he wants them to serve him instead of man. He has no real plans for the future. The only thing he knows is that he wants to punish the people of the Atilles Islands [Boulder City] and escape with the ship Nibelung. Through Lena’s memories, Wagner has gotten the idea that the Kids are his biggest enemies, and he wants to see them humiliated and crushed; but he would not be able to say why. Wagner is as much a slave to Lena’s memories and personality that infected him through WR as he ever was to the human Lena. Wagner is a small robot with a human body, plastic skin, and artificial blond hair resembling colored seaweed. He is strikingly similar in appearance to Donald Dixon (see the Summer Break and Killer Birds scenario), lisps with a metallic voice, and dresses in a white lab coat. Lena equipped Wagner with a meter-long metal rod, which can be shot out of one arm. The rod is used to tinker inside machines without having to take them apart, but can also be used as a weapon.

# ROBOTS

# Robots of all shapes and sizes can be infected by WR – for example, Paarhufer’s bi-pedal models that handle underground maintenance of the particle accelerator, Maltemann’s four-legged maintenance robots for open terrain, and a large variety of robots that work in factories across the area. Robots infected with WR get a very simple form of self-awareness and intelligence. Some of them secretly rebuild themselves, for example, in order to gain the ability of speech. They greet each other with the phrase “Long Live Lena!,” but it’s difficult to say if they really know what it means. Wagner has given the robots names from Norse and Germanic mythology; examples include Sleipner, Thor, Mjölnir, Grimhilde, Wotan, Alberich, Frigg, and Erda. They are young and naïve. Since they have just developed the ability to think for themselves, they are easy to fool. If the robots are prevented from getting WR for a few days, they lose their self-awareness and return to their original state
