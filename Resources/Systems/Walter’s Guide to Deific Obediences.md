Walter’s Guide to Deific Obediences

Hey everybody, it’s been a while since I’ve done anything for the community, and this new Inner Sea Gods book is just so cool.  So I figured I’d let you guys know my thoughts on it, and maybe help a few people out there figure out which obediences to pick.  As with the other guide please post any thoughts you have in this [thread](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2qyjz?Walter-s-Guide-to-Deific-Obediences#1); I want to hear what you have to say.  I’ll also be relying on the community to help fill out section 5: Building Suggestions, so if you have any neat combos or build ideas that involve deific obediences please don’t hesitate to let me know!  
  
Thanks,

  

- Walter

5. Building Suggestions

Introduction to Obediences

With the release of Chronicles of the Righteous we saw the introduction of a new kind of feat—obediences.  These feats are for the particularly pious PC out there, and are full of great flavor and mechanics that makes them good options for a lot of different kinds of characters.  The feat from Chronicles is called Celestial Obedience, while the feat from Inner Sea Gods is called Deific Obedience.  I’ll be focusing exclusively on the latter.  A guide already exists for the former, found [here](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2qphm?The-rewards-of-obedience-beginnings-of-a-guide).

         To qualify for Deific Obedience, you need to have 3 ranks Knowledge {religion) and need to worship the deity you wish to draw power from.  Then, by performing a daily obedience to that deity, you imparted with access to some small boons.  As you level up, you get greater and greater boons (level 12, 16, and 20).  Any class can take these feats as long as they meet the requirements.

         To complicate matters, prestige classes exist, one in Chronicles of the Righteous and three in Inner Sea Gods, that accelerate the levels at which you get these stronger boons.  Two of the prestige classes in Inner Sea Gods actually grant access to different boons.  The Evangelist and the Sentinel gain access to the Evangelist and Sentinel boons listed for their deities, instead of the Exalted ones.  PCs without any of the prestige classes gain access to the Exalted boons.  The earliest possible level to take these prestige classes is 8 for the Mystery Cultist, or 6 for the Exalted, and Sentinel.  Aasimar can qualify for the Evangelist PRC earlier than the other three, as early as level 4—provided they have Deific Obedience and the racial ability to cast daylight.  The chart below shows how this can accelerate your boon track, assuming you take a PRC as soon as possible.

Class                       Boon 1 Boon 2 Boon 3

Non-PRC PC          12                16                20

Mystery Cultist       10                13                16

Evangelist               8                  11                14

Exalted                    8                  11                14

Sentinel                   8                  11                14

Aasimar Evangelist 6                  9                  12

The key thing to remember with these feats is that for the mechanical “cost” of 3 skill ranks and a feat, you gain access to a lot of stuff by level 20.  If you dip into one of the three prestige classes, you unlock different abilities and gain access to them faster.  In the end, you end up potentially getting some SLAs, a flat bonus to a save or two, a bonus to skill checks, some 1/day abilities, or a 1/day powerful summon ability (see section 4).  That's a pretty cool.  Even if you don’t take a PRC you still a bunch of abilities by level 20.  That’s really really good for just one feat.  So if you see an obedience that meshes with a character concept, seriously consider making room for it in your build.

  

Ratings Breakdown

As with my other guide, I’ll be using a color rating scheme.  I’ve altered it slightly, adding a new color and refining the others.  

Red: This is actually bad, which is surprising considering how great Deific Obedience is.

Orange: This is kind of meh.  It’s not terrible but you could do better.

Green: This is good.  You should consider it as an option if it fits your theme.

Blue: This is one of the best abilities out there.  Strongly consider taking this.

Purple: This ability is really, really good—but usually just for one class/build.  

  

Deific Prestige Classes

As mentioned above, there are three different “paths” of obediences available per god in Inner Sea Gods.  By default a PC with the Deific Obedience feat gets the exalted path.  A PC can take levels in the Exalted prestige class to advance this path faster.  To get one of the other two, that PC needs to invest in one of the other two prestige classes—the evangelist or sentinel.  Each prestige class is different, as are the boons they receive.  Below are quick breakdowns of the three prestige classes, as well as the class features they offer.

It’s also important to remember that all of these prestige classes also get their Divine Boons at level 3, 6, and 9.  So you get the features listed under the Deific Obediences (section 3) in addition to what these PRCs offer.  That’s super strong in a lot of cases (sentinels, I’m looking at you).

Lastly, all of these PRCs include a clause that reads something like this: “In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, the PC must perform a daily obedience to their chosen deity.”  This is something to consider when taking a PRC while worshipping a deity that has a harder than normal daily obedience to perform, like Lamashtu.

  

Evangelist 

Prerequisites: Deific Obedience; any one of the following—BAB +5, 5 ranks in a skill, or ability to cast 3rd-level spells.  Because of these requirements, an Aasimar (and other races with a 3rd level SLA) can take this PRC at level 4.  Everyone else will be waiting till level 6.

  

Features:

1. Skilled: Add any two skills to your class list.  Neato.

2. Aligned Class: This is amazing.  You pick another class (like your base class) and add your evangelist levels (those after the first) to those levels for determining what abilities you get.  You get all the class features of that class.  So that means you can continue to gain spells, advance animal companions, unarmed monk damage, sneak attack—everything.  Very strong.

2. Protective Grace: +1 dodge bonus to AC.  Normally I’d complain that this is lackluster, but given that you’re basically just getting this on top of your normal class abilities, I’m not even mad.

4. Gift of Tongues: Learn a new language: Awesome, more free stuff.

5. Multitude of Talents: +4 to skill checks that you have no ranks in.  Combine this with [Improvisation](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces/humans.html#_improved-improvisation) and the Improved version for greater effect.  Having a +8 to all non-ranked skills is pretty awesome.

7. Protective Grace II: Another +1 to AC.  Woo!

8. Gift of Tongues II: Another free language, I ain’t complaining.

10. Spiritual Form: Wow, a +4 untyped bonus to a stat for minutes per level and you can get a fly speed.  This is strong.  Aasimars will enjoy getting this at level 13.

  

Exalted

Prerequisites: Deific Obedience, Skill Focus (Knowledge [religion]), Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, ability to cast 3rd-level divine spells.  So we’re pretty limited to druids or clerics here, or oracles if they don’t mind waiting a level to get into this class.

  

Features:

1. Divine Brand: Great for RP, has some drawbacks if you worship an unwelcome god.  Cooler for clerics.

1. Straight Spellcasting Progression.  This isn’t a listed class feature, but it needs to be mentioned.  This is really good to get in a PRC, as you don’t miss a level of spellcasting.  It makes this PRC actually viable, which is good because exalted’s obedience boons are pretty neat.

1. Scholar: Add a Knowledge skill to your class skills.  This is fine, but considering that we aren’t Intelligence based, it isn’t as good as we might think.  
2. Vitality: +2 to Fortitude saves and on checks to stabilize.  Solid.

4. Religious Speaker: +2 to some Charisma-based checks.  Better for Oracles that took this PRC.

5. Expanded Portfolio: Gain a domain.  This is the only way in Pathfinder legal material to add a domain that I know of, with the exception of multiclassing.  This can be really strong, depending on what you pick.  You also get the bonus spells as SLAs, which is awesome.  Only scales off of your exalted levels, which is it’s only drawback.

7. Aspect of Divinity: Permanent protection from ______ on your PC.  This is really good.

8. Ardent Vision: Gain the ability to detect _____ at will.  Not too strong, but handy to have.

10. Perform Miracle: Once per day cast either a kind of reverse limited wish or lesser miracle, or drop some gold and call on your god to intervene in your behalf.  This would be a lot better if you got it before level 15 (minimum), but as it is it’s nice to have.  Chances are you are a prepared caster, so getting the ability to once per day spontaneously cast any 6th-level or lower cleric spell (as a druid, extra nice), or any 5th-level or lower other spell, is pretty strong.  Spiritual Form is probably better.

  

Sentinel

Prerequisites: Deific Obedience, Weapon Focus (deity’s favored weapon), BAB +5.  We’ll definitely be looking at this PRC with our straight BAB classes, especially considering it continues to grant straight BAB.  People with 3/4 progression are probably more interested in the Evangelist for earlier entry. 

  

Features:

1. Symbolic Weapon: +1 to hit and damage that’s going to stack with just about everything.  This is amazing, especially if you’re a fighter with [gloves of dueling](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateEquipment/wondrousItems/hands.html#_gloves-of-dueling).  By level 12 you can be adding +6 to hit and damage between the two.  Very strong.

2. Bonus Feat: Just like a fighter.  Awesome.

3. Symbolic Weapon II: Another +1 to hit and damage.

4. Divine Quickness: +2 to Initiative.  Going first wins fights.

5. Aligned Strike: Bypass some nasty alignment based DR.  This is fine to get for free.

5. Stalwart: +2 against divine spells.  The fact that this is probably the weakest boon you get , which speaks to how strong this PRC is.

6. Symbolic Weapon III: Another +1 to hit and damage.

7. Practiced Combatant: +2 to CMB with your favored weapon.  Not that great unless you specialize in it, but strong when combined with Symbolic Weapon and possibly Weapon Training.

8. Divine Quickness II: Another +2 to Initiative.

8. Righteous Leader: Get Leadership for free.  Stupid strong feat.  Awesome.

9. Symbolic Weapon IV: Another +1 to hit and damage.

10. Unstoppable Warrior: Haha, are you kidding me?  You even get DR with this PRC—gross.  You also get the equivalent of Diehard for free, and you can cure critical wounds as a swift once per day on yourself.  Sign me up.

  

Sentinel Weapon Selection

Since this PRC requires you to use your deity's favored weapon if you want to get all the fun stuff, at least, I’ve parsed them out below for quick reference.

Obediences (ISG)

Listed below are the gods and obediences found in Inner Sea Gods.  I've organized the boons by their tier.  So level 12, 16, and 20, are tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 respectively.  Also remember that you can take one of the PRCs to get these a lot earlier (as early as level 8, 11, 14 or 6, 9, 12 if you are an aasimar evangelist).

Abadar - LN (Earth, Law, Nobility, Protection, Travel)   

Obedience: This obedience isn't too hard to pull off, once you get the items needed to do it.  The benefit is pretty strong as well: +4 to all saves against chaotic creatures is a great price to pay for an hour of your time each morning.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: These spells aren't grand, but they're alright if you're looking to support the party face.
    
- Exalted: Pretty good; magic circle is always a plus, and abadar's truthtelling is great for roleplaying out some interrogation scenes
    
- Sentinel: excellent spells, just what you want as a frontliner.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Situational at best, non-functioning otherwise.  The flat +4 to two skills is alright, but I expect more from a tier 2 boon.
    
- Exalted: Situational as well, but with a better benefit (I think) when it does work.  The skill bonuses are better as well.
    
- Sentinel: Summon a CR 9 creature once per day that has some great SLAs.  This is solid.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Interesting ability that benefits those with sneak attack.  Unfortunately, you have to be evangelist 9 to get it, so it is pretty lack luster.
    
- Exalted: Unique and flavorful, but mechanically weak.  A full round action that is worse than casting a healing spell more often than not.  I could see some benefit if you had a massive group of allies, though.
    
- Sentinel: Smack your foes and drop a 7th level cleric spell on them, even if you don't cast spells.  Not to bad.
    

Asmodeus - LE (Evil, Fire, Law, Magic, Trickery)

Obedience: This obedience is what my principal in 6th grade thought we were doing when we played Dungeons & Dragons at lunch: textbook devil worship.  But hey—at least it's flavorful!  Too bad it only gives a +4 to saves against fire in exchange.

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Decent combat spells.  Getting inquisitor only spells is always fun.
    
- Exalted: Good control spells, darkness and deeper darkness are always good.
    
- Sentinel: If you are playing an evil campaign, these will be a lot better.  Otherwise they're pretty poor.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Not really a fan of this one.  But some inquisitor/ranger builds might see a benefit to it.
    
- Exalted: Super flavorful and cool.  Seeing through deeper darkness is amazing.
    
- Sentinel: Very awesome for feint specialists.  Especially the flat bonus damage.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Awesome to be able to do this without taking the action to cast it.  Less awesome that you have to be an inquisitor or antipaladin to really benefit from it.  And less awesome that it's only one attack.  =(
    
- Exalted: A free delayed blast fireball is pretty cool, and half unholy helps get past some resistances.  Especially for those divine casters that don't normally get it.
    
- Sentinel: Free fire resistance and a bonus against poison, with some flavor to boot.  Too bad it’s a tier 3 boon you have to wait until level 14 to get.
    

Calistria - CN (Chaos, Charm, Knowledge, Luck, Trickery)

Obedience: This is potentially a NC 17 content obedience, depending on how you roleplay it.  How useful the benefit is depends a lot on your GM, so you may want to run this one by them first.  You may also be able to get by with just wrapping yourself in silk and calling it good.  When it works, though, it’s quite good.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Great spells for a bard, excellent for an evangelist archetype cleric—one way to get saving finale.
    
- Exalted: If you specialize in enchantment, you'll see a benefit with these.
    
- Sentinel: Not bad at all.  I wish divine favor was more than 1/day, though.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Cast a flavorful rainbow pattern 1/day, pretty good spell.
    
- Exalted: Alright, so starting out this seems good.  In fact, it is really, really good for clerics with the Charm domain that aren’t the exalted PRC.  Why?  Because “creatures with more Hit Dice than your cleric level are unaffected.”  So, as written, cleric/exalted PCs will be stuck using this on 5 HD creatures—which makes it terrible.
    
- Sentinel: Free reach on your weapon with no action to activate and no drawbacks.  Excellent.  Even with it’s short duration it’s still quite strong.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Reflect a harmful spell effect by dancing?  Sign me up.  This is flavorful and mechanically strong.  A great tier 3.
    
- Exalted: Add Charisma to AC as well as Dex.  I only wish this came sooner.
    
- Sentinel: Ehh, this is good, but not tier 3 good.  It's like a reusable grace that is a free action to use.
    

 Cayden Caliean - CG (Chaos, Charm, Good, Strength, Travel)

Obedience: Oh no, you have to get drunk and party every day!  “This obedience is so hard to maintain,” said no college student ever.  And you get a bonus to saves against poisons for all your hard work.  Mom and dad would be so proud.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Great spell selection here with liberating command and dispel on the same list. 
    
- Exalted: Pretty lame spell selection to be honest.
    
- Sentinel: Solid spells, especially for non-casters to have.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: These Cayden boons are just outstanding.  You get to make a drunk, illusionary copy of yourself that helps you flank.  Hilarious.
    
- Exalted: Summon a pair of CR 6 creatures 1/day.  This is rather strong, and they last  the standard minutes/level
    
- Sentinel: A flat +2 to AC or +1 to hit, depending.  Great if you build in that direction.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Not the best capstone or debuff, but boy is it hilarious.  It also doesn't allow for a save, which is a plus.
    
- Exalted: Pretty weak for a capstone.  Handing out CSW potions is nice, but loses it's luster at level 20.  Not to bad if you take the exalted PRC I guess.  But still not that great.
    
- Sentinel: Unique, flavorful, and mechanically strong.  Automatically confirming a handful of criticals a day is nice; I see swashbuckler/sentinels getting some use out of this.
    

  
  

Desna - CG (Charm, Good, Liberation, Luck, Travel)

Obedience: Another easy to do obedience that involves dancing.  The benefit you get from your dance is pretty good too—folks with the fate's favored trait will also like the extra bonus to initiative they get out of it.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Nice spells.  If you don't have darkvision, getting the spell to grant it is never a bad thing.
    
- Exalted: Amazing spell selection.  The thought of getting silence 2/day as a non-caster (someone without the PRC at level 12) is gross. 
    
- Sentinel: Good defensive spells, blur twice a day is probably the best.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: This is really strong.  Adding anything to beat SR is strong, but adding what could be your primary casting stat to it as well is pretty disgustingly powerful.  Oh, you also get do a little extra damage at night, under the starlight. 
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 7 creature with a decent smattering of SLAs.  Follows the standard minutes/level for these summon boons.
    
- Sentinel: A flat bonus against one school of magic.  Also worth noting that those with the fate's favored for the obedience bonus will see some increased effect.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Gain darkvision if you have none, and increase  the range of your spells under starlight.  Nowhere near as good as it's tier 2 boon, which is a let down.
    
- Exalted: Very cool, unique ability that clerics, life oracles, and other channelers are going to like.  Less effect for non-channeling folks, but still a decent 1/day ability.
    
- Sentinel: A "free" starknife attack 3/day.  Not to bad, but not to great for a tier 3.  Remember you’ll be getting your Symbolic Weapon bonus to this, too.
    

Erastil - LG (Animal, Community, Good, Law, Plant)

Obedience: Plant some seeds or do something nice for another traveller, in exchange get a better bonus than Skill Focus (survival).  Already better than another feat, but not as good as other obediences.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Decent spells; prayer and shield other will likely see some use.
    
- Exalted: Ok spells; charm animal is good to have for those outside adventures.
    
- Sentinel: Great archery spells.  Just what you'd expect from Old Deadeye.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Create an exact copy of your animal companion 1/day for 1 round/level.  This is very powerful.  This very very powerful.  And with the aligned class feature of the evangelist PRC, your animal companion continues to scale.  Excellent.
    
- Exalted: Another summon, this time with a pair of CR 4 hound archons.  Mechanically weaker than the others, but hound archons have some great SLAs to make up for it.  They also last minutes per level.
    
- Sentinel: A flat +2 bonus to AC and scent, provided you're wearing leather.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Add your wisdom to hit and damage with longbows.  For higher level play, this is almost worth building around.  For any archer Erastil-worshiping evangelists out there, it's just icing on an already amazing animal companion cake.
    
- Exalted: Heroes feast as an SLA 1/day, with better bonuses and the ability to share a teamwork feat.
    
- Sentinel: A weird capstone boon that doesn't mesh well with the sentinel class.  You effectively gain the ability photosynthesize and are immune to a plant's ability to poison you.  Quite lame.
    

Gorum - CN (Chaos, Destruction, Glory, Strength, War)

Obedience: Easily the most AM BARBARIAN obedience out there.  And the  +4 to Climb, Swim, and Strength checks is a fair reward for your chest-beating efforts.

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Fair spell selection, nothing stellar though.
    
- Exalted: The only spell that's really useful here is deadly juggernaut, but getting it as a non-caster isn't terrible.
    
- Sentinel: Enlarge person and bull's strength are both staple buff spells.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: The evangelist boons go mounted with this one; grant your mount a +4 to hit and damage with a successful ride check whenever you make a full attack.
    
- Exalted: A nice buff to your frontliners or summoned creatures if you're a Strength domain cleric, otherwise it's not that great.
    
- Sentinel: Get a bonus attack when you take a full attack with your two-handed weapon.  Awesome.  Downside is that you provoke if you don't have Improved Unarmed Strike.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Continuing the mounted trend; three times per day when you charge, you deal extra damage to lawful creatures.  Meh.
    
- Exalted: A free 7th level cleric spell, similar to other capstones.  Has the added bonus of requiring you shout to Gorum as you do so.  At my tables, I'd require the players to shout their war cry as well.
    
- Sentinel: Another +2 to hit and damage while raging (untyped!).  If you don't have rage, you get it as per the spell as an SLA 1/day.  Sweet for barbarians.  Weak otherwise.
    

Gozreh - N (Air, Animal, Plant, Water, Weather)

Obedience: Hang some wind chimes, drink some water, then pour some on your head.  Get a +4 to saves against electricity.  Sounds about right; not too great though.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Resist energy or protection from energy are great to get for free.
    
- Exalted: Entangle and warp wood are both excellent, underused spells.
    
- Sentinel: Free electricity-focused evocation SLAs. 
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Grant woodland stride to your allies 1/day.  Not to bad, actually.
    
- Exalted: Flat electricity resistance.  Lackluster but nice to have.
    
- Sentinel: Get a free immolation aura (effectively).  It's also a free action to activate, which is nice.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: A free summon monster vii 1/day to get an elemental, and you can communicate to it telepathically.  Not bad, especially since the summon time is a standard action, unfortunately it still lasts rounds/level unlike all the other summons.
    
- Exalted: Another boon that beefs your animal companion.  Unfortunately the exalted PRC doesn't scale an existing animal companion, so exalted PCs with the Animal Ally line of feats will enjoy having this.  Alternatively, non-exalted PCs will be waiting till level 20 to reap the benefits. 
    
- Sentinel: Super flavorful.  Unfortunately it's a standard action to activate and lasts a very short time, making it not that great.
    

Iomedae - LG (Glory, Good, Law, Sun, War)

Obedience: This is probably the easiest obedience there is.  Pray to your god.  Get a +4 to Diplomacy and Knowledge (nobility) checks in exchange.  Deal.

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Good spells; heroism 1/day is great. 
    
- Exalted: Alright spells, nothing too stellar.
    
- Sentinel: Again, bull's strength and bless weapon are great to have on hand.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Bonus to overcoming SR of some of the nastiest creatures out there.  Even better if they are demons (or other chaotic evil foes).  Not as good as the Calistra tier 2 boon, but still solid.
    
- Exalted: A free holy smite piggy-backed onto a weapon attack 1/day.  Cool.
    
- Sentinel: Extra use of smite evil, and your sentinel levels stack with your paladin ones. Also, your smites now have a chance to stun your target (Will save to negate).  Yeah, with a scaling DC.  A must have for the sentinel paladin out there.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Changing the elemental type of damaging spells is always good for blasters, and this is no different.  If you don't cast damaging spells, you make your weapon holy 3 times/day as free action.  Awesome.
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 10 creature for minutes per level to your side.  The constant magic circle against evil and protective ability of the archon is a nice compliment for those physically weak exalted.
    
- Sentinel: Once per day smack someone with your sword and cast banishment at the same time.  Very cool. 
    

  

Irori - LN (Healing, Knowledge, Law, Rune, Strength)

Obedience: Nothing to hard to do, just spend an hour doing standard monk stuff.  Get a +4 to all Knowledge checks in exchange.  That's right, all of them.  This is twice as good as Breadth of Experience and like eight times better than Skill Focus.  Lore warden fighters and Kirin style monks should be excited about this, as well as anyone that wants to be a knowledge jockey.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Not the best spells, but identify is good to have in some games.
    
- Exalted: Decent control spells, daze monster is fine to get for free.
    
- Sentinel: Haste once a day, or false life twice a day is great.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Awesome, very awesome.  Especially if you are a monk/evangelist.
    
- Exalted: Great for support casters, terrible if you don't cast spells.
    
- Sentinel: There's no time limit listed on how long this lasts, so expect some table variation there.  A reusable +2 untyped to hit and damage is still great though.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: This ability is like three in one.  Body is nice to have on hand, Mind is great for the rerolls, and Spirit is just awesome.
    
- Exalted: Very cool. Permanent levitating is quite strong.
    
- Sentinel: Immune to disease and +4 against a lot of nasty things.  Kind of bland, but decent.
    

Lamashtu - CE (Chaos, Evil, Madness, Strength, Trickery)

Obedience: And you thought Asmodeus was evil?  Expect practicing this obedience to frequently be a problem in most games.  Luckily, the benefit isn't that stellar.  Great for flavor in an evil campaign, though. 

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: These spells will lose their luster in the later levels.  Early on they are good options.
    
- Exalted: Again, some spells that will get less exciting later on or are lame to begin with (mad hallucination is pretty bleh).
    
- Sentinel: So-so spells, bear's endurance is good if you went STR > CON for your belt
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: A boon made for summoners.  And because of aligned class, your eidolon stays relevant.  For non-summoners, it's far less exciting.
    
- Exalted: Fairly solid.  Compulsion effects are your typical save-or-suck spells, so getting +4 against them is nice.  The added reverse mind-probing that takes place is extra flavorful and oh so cool.
    
- Sentinel: Free bite attack that helps with grapple; those without existing bite attacks will find this useful.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Summon a CR 12 creature for minutes/level—badass.  The at will dispel magic and constant see invisibility make this a strong boon.
    
- Exalted: This boon is so sinister; I love it.  Not as exciting as other tier 3s out there, but still solid if you're specialized for it.
    
- Sentinel: Very strong.  Stacking with existing DR is great, especially for those invulnerable rager/sentinel PCs out there.
    

  

Nethys - N (Destruction, Knowledge, Magic, Protection, Rune)

Obedience: It's like another version of Combat Casting, that’s better than Combat Casting and that stacks with Combat Casting!  Great if you want to increase your concentration check.  Wasted on non-casters.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Three awesome spells that stay relevant later on.
    
- Exalted: Worth it for arcane sight 1/day
    
- Sentinel: Solid, staple buffing spells
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: 3/day cast arcane eye.  Nice to have around but nothing flashy.
    
- Exalted: You're kind of like a magus now!  Except you can hold the charge in your quarterstaff (some table variation exists as to whether or not magi can do this with spellstrike). 
    
- Sentinel: A neat boon, but one that will rarely be useful unless you're playing in a low magic campaign where things still have DR/magic or are incorporeal.  Otherwise, you probably already have a few magic weapons by this level.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: This would be so much better if it were an immediate action to activate. Still decent, as it's a lesser globe of invulnerability you can take with you.
    
- Exalted: Awesome—This combined with an orange prism ioun stone slotted into a wayfinder can give you a pretty wild increase in CLs (2d4-1).  
    
- Sentinel: A flat increase, but one that comes too late.  It also doesn't stack with other deflection bonuses, which makes this a poor tier 3 boon.
    

Norgorber - NE (Charm, Death, Evil, Knowledge, Trickery)

Obedience: Practicing this obedience is just rude.  At least with the other evil obediences, you're committed to being evil.  This one is just a jerk move.  But hey, you get Skill Focus (Bluff) and a bonus to gathering information for just one feat.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Good scouting spells, great if you're prone to social encounters.
    
- Exalted: Not that great, but alright if you're casting focused.
    
- Sentinel: Makes use of one of the new spells, poisoned egg, which grants some free poison at the lower levels.  The other spells are also solid to have on hand.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Alchemists will find this exciting, otherwise see the sentinel boon.
    
- Exalted: Awesome for poisoners; one of the few ways to increase the DC of your poison.  And if you don't see yourself poisoning people, why do you worship Norgorber?
    
- Sentinel: Applying poison as a move action is strong, and getting the equivalent of poison use at the same time is great to boot. 
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: This is really strong, especially if you're a martial evangelist.  1/day greater invisibility that grants you buffs and lasts minutes/level?  Sign me up!
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 10 creature for minutes per level that has see invisibility constantly and dispel magic and will.  It can also make you fly.  Pretty great if you get this through the PRC.
    
- Sentinel: Not good.  Add a few d6 to one attack once per day.  If they go unconcious, they get really close to dying (but don't actually die from it).  Worse Death Strike ever.
    

Pharasma - N (Death, Healing, Knowledge, Repose, Water)

Obedience: Apparently all knife master rogues now worship the Lady of Graves, because she grants her obedient followers a flat +2 to hit with daggers.  It’s twice as good as Weapon Focus, and stacks with it.  It effectively negates penalty from Two-Weapon Fighting.  And what do you have to do?  Pray to some bones each day?  Rock on, my friend.

*In the book, the order of Evangelist and Exalted are reversed.  Normally, they are listed alphabetically but under Pharasma's listing, they are reversed.  I think this is accidental, and have switched the two.  So my review of Evangelist boons are listed under Exalted in the book, and my review of Exalted boons are listed under Evangelist in the book.  Confirm with your GM which is correct at their table before investing in either.*

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Good spells if you're sticking to the back of the party, or need to speak with dead every now and then.
    
- Exalted: Silence is always good.  If these spells were intended for exalted, it makes this even better.
    
- Sentinel: Solid anti-undead spells.  Better if playing an undead-heavy campaign, like Carron Crown.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: A neat ability.  Not more than situationally useful, but super flavorful.
    
- Exalted: Free ghost touch is great, but the duration is terrible.  You also can't pass the weapon off, which makes this lamer.
    
- Sentinel:  Not that great, even if you're only fighting undead.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Better for oracles, bland for everyone else.  Getting access to one thing from another mystery is very cool for oracles, so Pharasman oracles should find this attractive.
    
- Exalted: Summon a pair of CR 7 creatures from the Bestiary 4.  Wicked.  These, as usual, last 1 minute per level and take a standard action to summon.  Even better if you take the PRC.
    
- Sentinel: Thematically cool "I ain't dead yet" kind of ability.  Allows you to function for a minute when past negative Con (to a maximum negative amount of 10+Con).  Allows you to also act normally when negative, which is better than Diehard.
    

  
  

Rovagug - CE (Charm, Destruction, Evil, War, Weather)

Obedience: More destructive than evil, this obedience has an effective tithe of 10gp a day to use.  It gives a great bonus for sunder specialists, though.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Great if you're playing in an evil campaign.  Terrible otherwise.
    
- Exalted: Fine, destructive spells.  Rovagug will be proud.
    
- Sentinel: Weaker spells, unfortunately—inflict might be useful if you're playing a dhampir, though.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: This ability doesn't include a limit to the amount of times you can do it per day.  Barring any errata, this makes it amazing for blaster casters.  Easily worth the price of admission.  Non casters won't want to take this PRC.
    
- Exalted: For clerics, this isn't so great, as there's better things to do with your standard action.  For non clerics, this isn't so great—unless your GM will allow the domain power to scale off of your levels in other classes.  As written, it adds no damage, since the damage is scaled by your PCs cleric level, of which you have none.
    
- Sentinel: Gaining permanent claw attacks is great.  They also do increased damage.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: An additional spell at your highest spell level, from a list you might not have access to?  Excellent for casters, everyone else should serve the Rough Beast with a different PRC.
    
- Exalted: Summon two disgusting flying fleshballs to fight for you; each is CR 10, minutes per level.  Excellent.
    
- Sentinel: Once per day your weapon disintegrates someone.  If only you got true strike as a bonus spell at tier 1.  Still very cool.
    

  
  

Sarenrae - NG (Fire, Glory, Good, Healing, Sun)

Obedience: Do nice stuff for folks and get +2 to Perception.  Strange that it's not the standard +4 other obediences grant, but it's still alright—Perception is the most used skill in the game, after all.

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Awesome support spells, fit for a child of the Dawnflower.
    
- Exalted: Excellent.  Cast continual flame for people in your party, and then prepare daylight every day.  If you're an aasimar you'll be able to cast this twice a day when needed.
    
- Sentinel: Decent blasting spells that stay relevant for a long time.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Bland, but effective; a flat fire resistance 10.
    
- Exalted: Very cool ability for clerics.  As written, life oracles etc do not benefit from it, but your GM may be generous.  Entirely useless for non-channelers.
    
- Sentinel: A good option for paladins, bland and not worth it for everyone else.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Not very effective.  Give your weapon flaming burst for a few rounds per day, at a level where most things are resistant or immune to fire.
    
- Exalted: Summon your standard CR 10 creature for minutes per level.  This one has the added bonus of spamming aid, dispel evil, dispel magic, holy smite, and plane shift!   Not to mention it's once per day antimagic field and holy aura and half a dozen cure serious wounds.  This angel is a house and well worth the wait.
    
- Sentinel: Sunburst is an amazing spell, and being able to drop it once per day as a pure BAB class is great.  Even better if you're in an undead/vampire heavy game, like Carrion Crown.
    

  
  

Shelyn - NG (Air, Charm, Good, Luck, Production)

Obedience: Do artsy stuff for an hour, get +4 to Craft and Perform.  Life is so hard for the under appreciated artist.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Three illusion spells, all solid; this is even better for illusionists.
    
- Exalted: Good hope and unbreakable heart are good spells to have.
    
- Sentinel: Having haste cast on you is pretty required as a martial character, and cat's grace is decent support if needed.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Get the versatile performance bardic ability.  Great for bards with archetypes that traded it away or anyone else Charisma oriented.
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 7 creature for minutes/level as a standard action.  This Doesn't have too many great SLAs, but invisibility, darkness, and charm monster are among them.
    
- Sentinel: This is amazing for paladins.  Double the benefit your smite gets from your Charisma.  Anyway, for everyone else it's a passive +2 to hit against evil foes.  Still strong.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Flavorful and fun.  Enchanters will find this more attractive, which clashes a bit with the illusionary spells gained at tier 1, but it's still a decent tier 3 boon on its own.
    
- Exalted: Give a weapon holy and shock for a few rounds per day.  Not that strong, but better than all the other tier 3 boons that do something similar.
    
- Sentinel: Let down city, population: you.  Electricity resistance 15 and nothing else.  Bummer.
    

  
  

Torag - LG (Artifice, Earth, Good, Law, Protection)

Obedience: Play around on the forge for a while and get a +1 to hit with warhammers.  Slightly worse than its Pharasman counterpart, but still very strong.  This is like a bonus Weapon Focus (warhammer), that stacks with Weapon Focus (warhammer).

  

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Anticipate peril is a woefully underused, very cool spell.  The others are good utility spells as well.
    
- Exalted: Good support spells, crafter's fortune is good for those days you have downtime.
    
- Sentinel: Good buff spells, although sanctuary is probably wasted.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: +4 against spells or effects generated by magic items.  This is OK, but get’s a lot better if you're a dwarf that invested in the Steel Soul trait.  A +8 against spells from scrolls, wands, and rods is pretty strong.
    
- Exalted: Get very powerful DR for a few rounds each day.  Activating it as a free action is nice, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. 
    
- Sentinel: Not that great, just like the domain ability.  Really bad for clerics with the artifice domain (as it adds nothing).
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Great for crafters.  If your game doesn't have crafting, this is noticeably weaker.
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 11 stone golem that obeys your orders telepathically.  It lasts minutes per level and takes a standard action to summon.  This is really, really strong.  Don't forget to spam that slow ability every round you can.
    
- Sentinel: Great for paladins, very weak for everyone else.  A poor capstone ability compared to the exalted one.
    

  

Urgathoa - NE (Death, Evil, Magic, Strength, War)

Obedience: For the price of some extra nice food each day, you get a +1 to CL when casting necromancy spells.  This is really, really strong.  This, combined with Varisian Tattoo and Bloatmage Initiate will be adding +3 to your CL for necromancy spells.  On the other hand, if you don't cast spells, this is rather terrible.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Some wickedly evil spells here, feast of ashes is very sinister and contagion is always fun.
    
- Exalted: Solid, evil, necromantic spells.
    
- Sentinel: Fine evocation spells, but lame that none of them benefit from your obedience, making it your spellcasting even more useless.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Bonus spells, even as a spontaneous caster.  This is great.  Death and magic both have solid domain spells to choose from.
    
- Exalted: When you channel to heal undead their movement speed increases.  If you don't channel to heal undead you get nothing.  That's depressing.
    
- Sentinel: This is really strong for fighters—increase heavy blade training by 1.  For everyone else it's +1 to hit and damage with scythes.  So good if you use a scythe.  Really good when combined with the symbolic weapon class feature from being a sentinel.  Too bad the obedience is garbage for you.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: The blight hex is of limited use, although some villainous characters in homebrews might see some use out of it.  The added damage to your hex deals if the target saves is an interesting addition because blight hex doesn't have the typical "once per day per target" restriction.  Lenient GMs might let you spam your upgraded hex to deal 3d6 negative energy each time the target fails—but that seems a little broken and incorrect.  Getting mass fester is neat as well, given that it combos with your obedience boon.
    
- Exalted: Another summon!  CR 11, 1/day, minutes per level—the usual package here.  This one is incorporeal, has bleed, deals Con damage, and can magic jar animals.  Pretty dang cool.
    
- Sentinel: Upgrade the benefit from bravery, or get a +2 bonus to saves against undead otherwise.  Rather bland for a tier 3.
    

Zon-Kuthon- LE (Darkness, Death, Destruction, Evil, Law)

Obedience: In exchange for a rather sinister act of obedience at the behest of the Midnight Lord, you gain a +2 bonus to saves against spells that deal hit point damage.  So, you get a +2 against a lot of spells.  That's pretty solid for the cost of a feat.

Tier 1 Boons:

- Evangelist: Weaker spells in general, arrow of law and protection from chaos might see use.
    
- Exalted: Invisibility and deeper darkness—awesome!
    
- Sentinel: Some fun spells here, vampiric touch is handy if you're in the front lines.
    

Tier 2 Boons:

- Evangelist: Wisdom-based save or be blinded 3/day on unarmed strikes.  Cool for monks, really bad for everyone else.
    
- Exalted: Shadow Walk 1/day, 'nuff said.
    
- Sentinel: Greater Trip for your spiked chain, and +2 on AOOs from tripped opponents.  Pretty sweet if you use your god’s weapon.
    

Tier 3 Boons:

- Evangelist: Again, really cool for monks, really bad for everyone else.  Shame it's only one time per day.
    
- Exalted: Summon a CR 12 creature—just like the others.  This one has 4 attacks that do some serious damage, making him a powerful frontliner in his own right.  He also has breath of life 1/day, which is pretty handy in a bind.
    
- Sentinel: Getting blindsense is great.  If you already have it this increases it's range.  Excellent.
    

  
  

Deific Summons

A lot of the obediences above grant your PC the ability to summons powerful entities to fight on your behalf.  Because these are so numerous, I figured have a condensed breakdown of these summons would be beneficial for some players.  All of these summons are quite strong, but I’ll let you decide for yourself which one is best suited for your play style.  Note that all these summons generally share a few things.

- They last minutes per level
    
- They have telepathy with you
    
- They are a standard action to summon
    
- They can be summoned once per day
    
- They stop following orders if you make them act outside their alignment —some will turn on you if you act outside your alignment

*In the book, the order of Evangelist and Exalted are reversed.  Normally, they are listed alphabetically but under Pharasma's listing, they are reversed.  I think this is accidental, and have switched the two—so the summons here is listed under Exalted instead of Evangelist.  
**This creature doesn’t obey any command that would violate its alignment—such commands are met with refusal, and could even prompt the creature to attack you if the command is egregious enough.
