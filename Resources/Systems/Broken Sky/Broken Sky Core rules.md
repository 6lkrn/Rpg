The Infinite Universe.

The world is harsh, but the universe is far worse than that. The life forms on every existing planet in the cosmos, sentient species, humans and aliens alike, strive to survive the uncertainty of the endless expanse of stars and galaxies. Many fight for their survival to cling to life; the others feast on the flesh and blood of those who fight to their death. There are thousands, if not millions of planets out there in the vast universe, where half of them are either populated by various intelligent species of engineers and spellcasters, extraterrestrial beings, fantastic beasts of fangs and wings, or all of the above.

  

Although it may sound unbelievable, magic and science coexist in this universe, often utilised by many living organisms for different purposes. However, the two completely unique laws of nature have brought eternal conflicts to the universe, ceaselessly arousing hatred of beings of different beliefs and religions, and sparkling wars between galactic factions or species of dissimilar origins.

# What is Broken Sky?

Broken Sky is a tabletop role-playing game set in the expanse of outer space, where a group of players (preferably from 3 to 6 players) create a common universe to play make-believe and explore the said universe together, with fictional science and fantasy combined. This book of guidelines will assist you in achieving a consistent and fascinating storytelling of your very own galactic tales.

  

One of the players will take on the role of the Game Master (GM for short). It is their task to build and describe a consistent and imaginable universe, filled with challenging foes, solar systems and space colonizations of good and evil. They will also act as a neutral referee of the rules, applying them fairly to the adventurer players, along with the non-player characters within the universe. They are the lead narrator of the storytelling game and should be respected by the adventurer players.

  

The other players take on the role of the adventurers, often working together as a crew to take up an interplanetary adventure between planets of dangerous terrains and weathers described by the GM, where adventurers might encounter fierce beasts and aliens, discover advanced equipment and precious magic items, or even be devoured by an all-consuming black hole which in fact teleports you to another universe. The possibility is limitless.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0URihEVqf3XWfqfo7GswVaJ7oN3dxwsOIw9-eWlhyD7rEThjdjWhypBgxG85vm7a4wAlVQVwRoWC4zpFtEpPMMOyzUQRlIVlgfGovR00VDnYYIXGhUwlSOecJmxHL2o_M-vc_NtyIuVIORNb62vwcQ)

Basic Gameplay Concepts.

  

Game Term Abbreviations. 

Broken Sky has many game terms that can be found throughout the book. Often abbreviations are used to indicate these terms. The main one that you will encounter are -

- HP: Stands for Hit Points or Health Points. These indicate how much health your character has. These points are reduced when your character takes damage.
    

All abbreviations will be explained in the glossary.

  

Dice Abbreviations.  
Throughout the book you will see phrases such as 1d6 and 1d20. These indicate how many and which dice are to be rolled. The first number indicated the number of dice to be rolled and the 2nd number indicated how many sides the dice should have. The d here simply stands for “dice”. For example, a 1d6 indicates that you should roll a single six-sided dice, a 4d8 indicates that you should roll four eight-sided dice and so on. 

  
  
  
  

Creating a Character

1. Choose a Race.

2. Choose a Class.

  

In order to play Broken Sky, you must first create a character to play. This character is not just a number of stats on a sheet. They embody your hopes, your dreams and your aspirations. You will adventure, fight, win and lose with these characters and they are the main method of storytelling. When creating your character you should consider the concept that appeals to you most. Do you want to be a reckless adventurer? A conniving trickster? A steadfast guardian? After deciding the general direction and personality of your character, it’s time to work on your backstory and character motivations. These are followed by your race and your class. 

  

Level

Your characters will have very key stats that can be found on your character sheet. The most important of these is your level. As your story progresses, your characters will progress and gain new skills and abilities. This is shown through levelling up. Levels unlock bonus abilities and stats, these are usually tied to your class. The GM decides how and when to reward levels. A classic method is through gaining experience points through adventuring and combat. Some parties may prefer a Milestone method that rewards levels by completing key points of the story.

# Racial Bonuses

Amphibious: A member of this species is adapted to life underwater as well as on land. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Constitutionx10 minutes on average). Its Dexterity is halved on land.  

  

Anti-Psionic: Members of this species are innately anti-psionic. The character’s Psionic Strength rating always equals zero, and they cannot be trained in psionics. In addition, the character cannot suffer the mental effects of psionics, including telepathy and psionic assault. A species cannot have this alien trait if they already have the Psionic alien trait.  

  

Aquatic: The alien is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Constitution x 10 minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is halved on land. If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot operate out of water without mechanical aid or telepresence.  

  

Armoured: The alien possesses thick fur, scales, a bony exoskeleton or other natural protection that gives it natural armour. +1 AC.

  

Atmospheric Requirements: The species requires an unusual combination of gases to breathe, and cannot survive in most atmospheres without artificial aid.  

  

Bad First Impression: Members of this species possess an almost universally unpleasant appearance or physical trait that invokes an instinctive reaction in races other than their own. Most races will automatically have an Unfriendly attitude towards these characters, although this is overcome after an individual has interacted with the character for a few minutes, based on the character’s personality and the circumstances of their interaction. Gain Advantage on  

  

Caste: Members of this species have a genetic structure for social hierarchy. When dealing with races that use Social Standing or Charisma, all social attribute DMs, whether positive or negative, are halved.  

  

Cold-Blooded: Members of this species are sensitive to cold climates. If exposed to extreme cold without protective equipment, the character suffers a DM–2 to initiative. The character suffers 1D6 damage for every ten minutes of exposure. 

Engineered: The species has been altered by some external factor to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment. Medical treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower Technology Level than that at which the species was created receives a negative DM equal to the difference. 

  

Fast Metabolism: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled. In combat, fast-metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative bonus. Fast-metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes of determining fatigue.  

  

Feral: Feral species are uncivilised, regardless of their technological knowledge. Feral species have -2 Intelligence.  

  

Flyer: This species can fly using wings. Characters of this species gain a flying speed. Winged flight is tiring and can only be sustained for a number of hours equal to the creature’s constitution before requiring a like amount of rest.

  

Great Leaper: Members of this species can jump great distances. As a significant action, a member of this species may make an Athletics skill check. If successful, it jumps four squares, plus a number of squares equal to the Effect of the skill check. In addition, members of this species are treated as having the Athletics skill at level 0.  FIX

  

Heat Endurance: Members of this species do not suffer hourly damage from the effects of hot weather and exposure.  

  

Heavy Gravity Adaptation: Members of this species evolved on a world with a higher gravity and do not have to acclimatize to high-gravity environments.  

  

Hive Mentality: Members of this species are driven by a hive mentality, and often pursue actions that support the greater good of their current identified family group, even at the risk of their own personal safety. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid risking their own safety when doing so would help their family group. The difficulty of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of perceived benefit to the family group.

  

Large: The species is considerably larger than average. Large creatures gain Strength and Constitution but lose Dexterity. Life support requirements for Large creatures are doubled. Some Large creatures are described as Huge. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a +1 to hit.  

  

Low Gravity Adaptation: Members of this species evolved on a world with a lower gravity and do not have to acclimatize to low-gravity environments.  

  

Low-Light Vision: Members of this species can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.  

  

Natural Pilot: Members of this species have an innate understanding of multi-dimensional space, and so receive a +2 to their Piloting and Navigation checks. 

Natural Swimmer: Members of this species are natural swimmers and gain a +2 on all skill checks related to swimming.  

  

Natural Weapon: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws, a strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons gain +1 to hit and damage. The creature gains Natural Weapons at level 0. 

Naturally Curious: Members of this species are driven by a natural sense of curiosity, and are easily dragged into any adventure. They have to check out everything and always want to know what’s behind a potential mystery. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid acting on their curious impulses. The difficulty of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of perceived mystery.

  

No Fine Manipulators: The species has no fingers or other prehensile appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up, pushing small buttons, reaching into tight spaces, and so on.  

  

Notable (Characteristic): Some species are notably dexterous, intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a positive Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (+2 unless otherwise specified).

  

Psionic: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character generation.  

  

Small: Small species lose Strength and Constitution and gain Dexterity. 

  

Slow Metabolism: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less food than most species, and their life support costs are halved. In combat, slow-metabolism creatures suffer a –2 initiative penalty.

  

Uplifted: This species was originally non-sentient, but has been raised to a higher intelligence by another species. Uplifted races generally become client species of their patron. Two common uplifted animals are apes and dolphins: 

Uplifted apes have Notable Strength and Endurance (+2) but all other characteristics are Weak (–2). They have the Uplifted trait. 

Uplifted dolphins have Notable Strength (+4) and Notable Endurance (+2) but Weak Intelligence, Education and Social Standing (–2). They have the Uplifted, Aquatic (fully aquatic, air-breathers) and No Fine Manipulators traits.  

  

Water Dependent: Although members of this species are amphibious, they can only survive out of the water for 1 hour before they begin gaining exhaustion. (After that, refer to the drowning rules). 

  

Weak (Characteristic): The opposite of Notable (Characteristic), some species are weaker, less resilient or less well educated than others. Characters from such races have a negative modifier when rolling for that characteristic (–2 unless otherwise specified).

  

Subclasses 

The following choices are just some of the options that exist for a character’s background. At the GM’s discretion, additional packages might be added or existing ones might be changed to suit a particular game setting.

  

## SOLDIERS

  

Courtesan: A rare subclass; you can start rumors and negotiations within the imperial court. You also have skills to raise your reputation, which can give you gold and items at random.

Courtesan 1 - adv on persuasion

Courtesan 2 - charm spell

Courtesan 3 - group persuasion and deception

Courtesan 4 - disguise spell

Courtesan 5 - command spell

Crusher: Increases damage dealt with blunt weapons.

  

Avenger: If the Player receives damage or is inflicted with an abnormal status, you have special skills that can help you take revenge on the one who did it.

  

Berserker: Increased resilience, provides HP absorption attacks and increased defense near death.

  

Bombardier: Bonus to explosive damage??? Proficiency in bombs and rpgs.

Guardian???Border Patrol: Provides strong defense in combat and takes heavy damage from foes, always holding ground as long as possible until victory or defeat. Also below

Protector: Can shield allies from damage, putting his own body on the line. 

  

Strategist: Can see through enemy weaknesses and assess plans.

  

Infiltrator: Proficient in sneaking into locations.

  

Captain: Proficient leaders.

  

Ace: Proficient at flying fighter vessels. 

  

Bounty Hunter: Know how to hunt and track targets. 

  

Oathsworn: Users that swear to follow certain rules and conditions. They gain bonuses. 

  

Sergeant: Ranked soldier with connections to the army. 

Samurai: 

  

Cavalier: Gain a charge ability. A wind up attack against enemies. 

  

Rogue: Allows you to steal from monsters, lay traps, rob people, lockpick, and eavesdrop. Not good with whole-body armor, though.

  

Scout: Increases detection range, allows the user to detect ambushes, and allows them to gain more information on enemies.

  

Armsman: Lostworlders often build their cultures on brute force and cold steel. These men and women are often in the pay of a local warlord or religious leader, using hard-won combat skills and a keen tactical eye to do their master’s bidding. Some of them who end up on the wrong side of a political question have reason to get offworld, and quickly. BRUTE ABILITIES? EDIT IT LATER

  

Bandit: In the absence of a strong local government, men and women can make a living stealing from others. These bandits often rely as much on their ability to evade vengeful hunters as they do on their accuracy with bow and blade. Some find their opportunistic ways leading them offworld when the chance arises. EDIT 

  

Gunnery Crew: Few ships mount enough weaponry to justify a complement of specialized gunners, but naval warships always have a substantial number aboard. Gun crew have a daredevil reputation in most navies. The massive capacitors and generators required in most gun emplacements have a tendency to be the first to blow during a heavy engagement, taking out the vast banks of fire control computers and the crew along with them.

  

Agent: Individual that secretly collects and reports information on the activities, movements and plans of a political or corporate enemy or competitor. Also known as a spy or intelligence operative.  EDIT LATER

  

Ranger: Individual that kills or traps large game, almost always large terrestrial mammals, for meat, other animal by-products (such as horn or bone), trophy or sport.  

Hunter: Have some overlaps with the Tracker subclass, such as increased accuracy and increased drop chances. One particularly notable ability of this subclass is its ability to “recover and reuse arrows.” 

  

Mercenary: Professional soldier hired to serve in a foreign military force or perform a specific military action.  

  

Pirate: Individual that attacks and steals from interplanetary and interstellar ships in space.  

  

Tracker: Can follow targets undetected, hide their presence, or move in the dark. In conjunction with the Assassin class, it can be used to dispatch enemies without being sensed at all. They can also be used with people with Hunter subclasses to find ingredients or prey. 

  

Spy: Inspired by movie spies, their skills help them with acting discreet and finding intel from NPCs. They also get infiltration and spying quests.

  

Sword Master: Gain proficiency in all blades?>>>  FIX

  

Tactician: Found in many raiding guilds, Tacticians support their allies with their skills and watch over the battlefield. Some of their skills allow them to be excellent timers. 

  

Dragon Warrior: A warrior who fights with the power of a dragon, granted by the "True Dragon.".

  

Duelist: A roleplaying subclass that represents one’s honor and chivalry in a one-on-one fight. You gain various bonuses during a duel, or some support skills to make a fight one-on-one. On the other hand, to display a “respect for a duel of honor,” poison skills and deceptive attack skills are forbidden. In other words, it would be a terrible decision for an Assassin to pick this subclass. \

  

Explorer/Pathfinder: Gain awareness of the surrounding terrain and monsters at a short distance. Can also create a magic map that will automatically write a map of the surrounding area.

  

Gladiator: Provides buffs in 1 on 1 duels. Gladiators are masters at dazzling the audience. Skills can only be activated in certain situations, such as “taking the opponent’s attack head-on,” or “the battle exceeded a certain duration,”.

  

Hitman: The same as the Man-Slayer subclass, although the two are separate subclass. Looks like it should be one of the Slayer subclasses, but it isn't. This subclass allows you to nullify the resistances or buffs of the opponent. It can also provide boosts in negotiations.

  

Holy Warrior: Exchanges some Warrior-class skills for recovery skills.

  

Knight: A classic subclass. Gives exclusive items and specific skills.

  

Mercenary: A subclass similar to the Knight in some aspects. Boasts a considerable amount of quests which makes it popular for lore-seeking or gold-farming players.

  

Phantom Thief: More of a performer and a burglar than a real thief, specialized in theatrical robberies.

  

Pirate: Pirates gain bonuses while fighting and exploring at sea. 

  

Master Swordsman: Legendary warriors with unparalleled skill with a blade.

  
  
  

## TECH

Analyst: Can analyse any program or database for key and important info.

  

Cartographer: Creates maps. Some monsters drop Treasure Maps, and it's up to the cartographer to decipher the map and hunt out the location of the treasure. Also lowers travel time.

  

Astrogator’s Mate: Scavenger Fleets and major spacecraft have an entire crew of astrogators dedicated to plotting the next spike drive path and navigating the dangerous energy fluxes of the space between. These men and women require further seasoning before they’d be trusted with a post as a full astrogator, but they still learn the essentials of the profession. 

  

Civil Servant: Similar to the Accountant, Scholar, Tactician, Negotiator and Scribe subclasses. Connections to government organisations and systems. 

  

Biotech Crew: A lot can go wrong in space, and few problems are as immediately lethal as a breakdown in a ship’s life support systems. Biotechs not only serve as medical crew but are also responsible for maintaining and repairing the ship’s life support.

  

Comm Crew: Commtechs operate a ship’s radio and lightbeam laser communications systems, and usually find additional duties in maintaining a ship’s computer software. A career spent talking to potentially unfriendly audiences gives most commtechs a great deal of practice at keeping a smooth, persuasive line of speech. 

  

Deck Crew: The “deck apes” make up the bulk of a ship’s crew, each one responsible for one of a host of back-breaking or dangerous duties. Modern ships lack much of the automation and redundancy of pretech starcraft, and the price of an extra crewman is often far cheaper than that of the robot or braked AI that would otherwise be necessary. 

  

Engine Crew: Ferocious radioactivity and arcing power makes the engine room of a large spacecraft into a deathtrap for an unwary engine “snipe”. Ancestral rivals of the “deck apes” on most ships, engine crew wear heavy protective suits while tending the bulky and temperamental postech engines of modern starships. 

  

Researcher: Advanced worlds rarely get that way without the help of researchers. The secrets of pre technology require a huge knowledge base to even understand, let alone replicate, and the mysteries of psitech remain locked to the vast majority of worlds. Sometimes a researcher finds it necessary to seek new data offworld. 

  

Scholar: The secrets of the past lie in both deeds and objects, and a scholar is often skilled in unearthing both. While they rarely concern themselves with precise specifics, many scholars have a breadth of understanding uncommon to the world bound denizens of a single planet. The urge to know the truth of things push them into dangerous expeditions offworld.

  

Technician: Individual that is skilled in mechanical or industrial techniques or in a particular technical field. Technicians keep an advanced world's technology running and its populace healthy. Some focus on inanimate tech, while others are medical experts who use sophisticated devices to keep their fellow humans in repair. Some sort of technical expert is all but indispensable on any expedition due to the need for repairs. 

  

Alchemist: Create potions and other consumable magic items. Among other things, you can create fire bombs, explosive potions, and low-level healing potions.

  

Apothecary: Brews potions.

  

Armourer: A derivative of the Blacksmith specialised in crafting and repairing armors.

  

Artificer: The most basic of the Production subclasses. Can craft all kind of accessories with a large variety of material.

  

Mechanic:  Proficient at repairing mechanical objects. A subclass known for being very difficult to acquire because one of the prerequisites to the quest to obtain it requires you to be a high-level glassblower. They can create various type of mecanism, from gears to steampunk-like machines.

  

Scientist: Individual that is engaged in and has expert knowledge of a science, especially a biological or physical science.  

  

Architect: Urban planners, more focused on design than actual building. Provides some skills for buildings and ships.

  
  

## MYSTIC

  

Arcanist: Alternatively called “Magic Scholar”. Allows the creation of magical consumable items like magic scrolls. Acquired from the Scholar subclass.

  

Mystic Rogue: A multi-class subclass. Get Magic-class skills in exchange for Weapon-class skills. Doesn’t seem to have much affiliation with the Rogue subclass.

  

Necromancer: They can summon undead creatures for miscellaneous purposes.. 

  

Puppeteer: A subclass that can both create and manipulate dolls. Sometimes used by Summoners along the Alchemist build.

  

Priest: Priests or religious leaders of some kind exist on almost every planet, and most of them couple sincere belief with a pragmatic knowledge of human nature. It's not uncommon for a priest to choose to take the blessed word to the heathens among the starsand find more success there than unbelievers might expect. 

  

Magical Artificer: Advances from the Alchemist subclass line. They specialise themselves in the making of magic tools.

  

Wand Master: Create consumable items that can be used to activate magic spells through the use of a wand. Derived from the Alchemist subclass. It has the advantage of not consuming MP when used and being usable by any Class, but its power, casting time, and general performance is at a visible disadvantage to a specialist’s. 

  

War Priest: Exchanges some Healer-class skills for Warrior-class skills.

  

Talismancer: A subclass that uses Talisman-based magic. Mainly a support-type subclass that uses lucky charms or incantations to defend against or counter an attack.

Rune Knight: Knights who can call upon magical runes in battle. As the name implies, it’s derived from the Knight subclass line. 

  

Sigilmancer: You can engrave runes onto an item, giving it a special effect. You can also put them onto your own body.

  

Specter User: Little is known about the subclass, but it likely meshes well with the Summoner's Necromancer build, as the only known user of this subclass runs that build. FIX

  

## SUPPORT

  

Diva: The Diva subclass allows an Adventurer to perform music-based skills in exchange for Weapon-class skills. A Bard with this subclass exchanges attack-strength for increased song power. Men can also be divas. FIX

  

Doctor: As the name suggests, it relates to the handling of medicine.

  

Commander: Represents a frontline commander that leads troops in combat. You can strengthen and support allies in large-scale battles. 

  

Connoisseur: Person with excellent taste. A [Sukisha](http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/suki.htm) is more properly labeled as a "Tea Master" and is a separate subclass from Connoisseur, but gives the same effects.

  

Courier/Deliverer/Delivery Man: This subclass gives bonus rewards for completing delivery quests (the higher the level, the more rewards you get as well), grants special mounts, and increases the amount of items you can carry.

  

Messenger: Knows how to transport messages around the universe safely and securely. Can bonuses when encrypting data.

  

Empath: User can sense the feelings, emotions and general mindset of other creatures. 

  

Poison User: Can create poison-based items, has boosted Poison skills, and has knowledge on various poisons and poisonous items/plants. Has the ability to poison their weapon. Effective against healers/healing spells, but not very effective against Undead, golems and other inorganic things.

  

Precant: A person who offers prayers and participates in rituals. However, they don't have a particular religious affiliation. 

Transport Specialist: Goods are worth little if they can’t get to a buyer, and transport specialists are there to provide the conveyance. Whether a hot zone grav trucker or a courier ship pilot, these specialists know how to use a steady hand on the wheel to make a delivery. 

  

Worker: Truck drivers, grounds keepers, factory workers, and a hundred other professions are described by this background. Even in advanced societies, there is usually some manner of labor that requires more patience than creativity, and those consigned to such work are often ready to seek something more rewarding among the stars. 

  

Blacksmith: Can create and repair equipment. Prerequisite for Armorer and Weaponsmith.

  

Brewer: Brews alcoholic drinks. If a Brewer creates it manually using Real Food Preparation, the drinks have flavor and take less time to create than in the real world.

  

Chef: Creates food items. The higher your level, the more complex recipes you can make.

  

Luthier: Can create almost any instrument that appears in an orchestra - string, woodwind, brass, percussion, and perhaps even some modern ones from the real world. A luthier specializes in stringed instruments like violins, guitars, and lutes. This profession can bring in quite a bit of gold, as people are willing to pay higher prices for rarer or more complex instruments, which makes up for the large amounts of materials and skill needed.

  

Diplomat: Individual that is appointed by a planetary or interstellar government to conduct official negotiations and maintain political, economic and social relations with another polity or polities.  

  

Entertainer: Individual that has achieved celebrity status for their proficiency in publicly entertaining others.

  

Physician: Individual that is skilled in the science of medicine and is trained and licensed to treat sick and injured people.  

  

Team Player: Helps his team with ability checks and other challenges.

  

Accountant: It provides the player a bonus when conducting business transactions or negotiations with NPCs or other players.

  

Herbalist: A basic subclass that handles potions and medicine made from plants. It is a staple for some advanced chemical-making subclasses.

  

Wuxia/Bukyo: Some attack motions change. Provides a hit bonus. Boosts party morale and mental resistance. 

  

Idol: Allows the user to make music. Its capabilities are not to be underestimated, since it can, when used properly, be almost at the level of a Special Title. An idol can gain some skills of the Dancer, Diva, and Musician subclasses.

  

Kagemusha: Serve as a body double for an official or general to prevent assassinations. To prevent pranks, it is necessary to get the permission of the one to be imitated. 

  

Musician: Allows you to play a musical instrument and create your own music rather than play from predetermined songs (such as a Bard’s skill). The difficulty level of songs that you can play increases with the subclass’s level. Unlike a Bard, who can “let go” of an instrument and still have their songs take effect, a Musician has to continue playing for the skills to trigger.

  

Negotiator: Mainly in the political field, working with nobles and merchants alike in dealing with trade and contracts. However, the Negotiator’s is automatically created, and their contracts can be magically enforced so that, if the contractor fails to abide by the contract, the Negotiator can levy a fine for the breach.

  
  

## GENERAL 

  

Synthetic: Being able to weaponize your body parts into blades/guns idk.

  

Acrobat: Take reduced fall damage (so you can fall from higher places and sustain less damage from it). They are also less affected by uneven terrain. 

  

Athlete: Bonus to athletics.

  

Outlaw: Has criminal connections and knowledge.

  

Scoundrel: Proficient at deceiving and tricking people.

  

Smuggler: Knows hidden routes and how to hide merchandise. 

  

Con Artist: Some thieves get what they want with a gun, but others find it easier with a kind word and a smile. Con artists are wise to keep moving ahead of their angry marks, but the trip can be an enjoyable one.

  

Hermit: Whether from a desire for solitude, an esoteric religious reason, or local fear of an untrained psychic, some lostworlders find a life as a solitary hermit. Those who would live off an unforgiving world's bounty must be wary and knowledgeable, and some come to tire of their solitude or seek a greater loneliness in the stars.

  

Noble: Almost every world has its elite, but some lost worlds or splinter cultures take the idea to an excess rarely found on more advanced planets. The nobility of most lost worlds has a degree of power over their lessers that would be unthinkable elsewhere, but the consequences of a political error can be correspondingly fatal. Those with the money and the chance often seek exile among the stars. Your initial title is ‘Sir’ but as you level up your title changes accordingly; Baronet, Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquis, Duke and Grand Duke. NPCs can give the “Honourable Conduct” and “Noble-like Behaviour” quests (details vary).

  

Nomad: Nomads can gain material from animals like horses and sheep, such as dairy products or wool, and can also create items from them such as ponchos and tents. 

  

Peasant: A surprising number of spacer families have started from a dirt grubbing lostworlder peasant who thought to find a better life in the sky. Tough, practical, and with a keen knack for holding on to the wealth that comes their way, peasants can often endure rigours that would put an end to less pragmatic folk. 

  

Politician: On most civilised worlds politics isn’t the blood sport it can be on more elemental worlds. Even so, there are times when a politician can find his or her best advantage in a lengthy span out of the public eye, preferably offworld. The best of them have a distinct knack for adapting to new power structures. 

  

Tribesman: Some are woad-painted lostworlder clansmen, while others are gangsters among looming habitat towers. Whatever their surrounding, tribals are those men and women who identify with a family or group above any outside law.
