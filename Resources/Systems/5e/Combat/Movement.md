**Jumping**

***Standing Long Jump.*** Jump feet equal to half your Strength score.

***Running Long Jump.*** Move 10 feet immediately before - jump feet equal to your Strength score.

***Standing High Jump.*** Jump feet equal to half of 3 + your Strength modifier.

***Running High Jump.*** Move 10 feet immediately before - jump feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier.
Your arms can extend above you equal to half your height.

**Swimming and Climbing**
Unless you have a swim or climb speed, you spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot traveled while swimming or climbing.

**Moving Around Other Creatures**
Can move through a nonhostile creature's space freely, but not through a hostile creature's space unless it is two size categories larger or smaller than you; it is difficult terrain for you. Cannot end move in another creature's space.

**Being Prone**
Drop prone without using any movement; stand up with half of your movement; move while prone by spending an extra foot of movement per foot moved.

**Flying Movement**
Flying creatures that are knocked prone, have their speed reduced to 0, or are deprived of the ability to move, they fall unless they have the ability to hover or are held aloft by magic.

**Squeezing into a Smaller Space**
Can move through a space one size category smaller than it, and must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot moved. Attack rolls vs. a squeezing creature have advantage.
