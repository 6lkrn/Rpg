5e Homebrew Race Catalogue

I’m looking to resume work refining my guide over the summer. If anyone has any ideas for making a more cohesive and usable guide, please message /u/JamesMusicus on Reddit.

  

This is a collection of example races made using my [5e Race Creation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViqLSEN67mmd2Lo_OJ-H5YX0fccsfI97kFaqx7V1Dmw/edit?usp=sharing). Many of the races were made using early versions of the scoring system, so please review them before use. Many of these races are also just examples of what such a race might have from their 5e traits, so changing them to suit your tastes is something I would encourage! Make sure to show this list to your DM if you want to use a race from it, because they both need to approve it and may want to include other races in their campaigns.

  

I have a website now: [http://zappyman2.wix.com/musicushomebrew](http://zappyman2.wix.com/musicushomebrew)

Bullywugs can use mud, swamp water, bile, or any other gross substance to coat themselves, repelling attackers and bolstering their own armor. Bullywugs can take 10 minutes to coat themselves in some vile substance and gain natural armor. This natural armor lasts until the bullywug washes itself or is rained on.

Shapechanger = 1

You may change your shape to that of any medium humanoid race as an action. You do not mimic the appearance of any individual in particular. You may do this once per short rest normally, as the process is very tiring, but suffer 1 level of exhaustion for each additional shapechange between short rests. Other Creatures can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC = your Charisma Score + your proficiency.

Changing Mind = 1

Because your body is shaped by your mental resonance across your crystalline structure, you may expend energy to reshape your body to some extent. Once per long rest, using 10 minutes of your time, you may integrate a weapon (or shield) into your body structure. To do so, you must have the weapon in front of you so you may study it and shape your body to match. This works with any weapon, but not as projectiles, so you must still buy ammunition. This does not consume the weapon, but rather copies it as an addition to one of your arms. When you have a weapon integrated, you cannot be disarmed by normal means.

Once a long rest, the treant can animate up to two trees within 60 feet of it.

The tree remains animated for 1 minute or until it dies; or until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible. (these treants add your proficiency to their AC)

Instead of sleeping, you enter a sleep-like state. You need to remain in it for only 4 hours each day. You need not dream; instead, you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

Forced Growths = 2

Because of your natural construction you have the ability to shape and reshape your body as needed. Once per short rest, you use your action to create any one handed weapon, a shield, or any tool that you are proficient with. An object created in this way degrades over the course of 1 hour, and weapons all deal bludgeoning damage. Once per long rest you may shield yourself from lethal damage. Instead of dropping to 0 hit points, you instead drop to 1 hit point. At your DMs discretion you may also use this feature to create any shape or object you can think of.

Crystalline Mind = 1

Once per short rest, when you are forced to make an intelligence, wisdom, or charisma save against a magical spell that affects the mind, you may grant yourself advantage to the save. Additionally, you take half damage from failed saves against these effects, and no damage from successful saves.

Any attached object cannot be removed from you unwillingly unless you cannot take actions.

When you are not wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. During a short rest, you can bond a suit of armor you are wearing to your body.
