- Using a consumable for themselves is a bonus action, handing it off is a bonus action, but feeding the consumable to another character is an action.
    
- 20 or 1 gives adv/disadv on first action
    
- Characters take a level of exhaustion when they're reduced to 0hp. This mitigates the "yo-yo'ing" we used to have where 1hp was enough.
    
- Death saves are gone entirely. When a character hits 0hp, they're "Desperate". They can take their turn as normal (move, attack, the whole shebang). Getting hit or failing a saving throw against spell damage gives you 1 level of exhaustion. Critical hits give 2 levels. Death by death saves was a boring, frustrating way to go. With this rule, PCs can save their own skin and fight to their last breath.
    
- Magic weapons don't cut through resistances, generally speaking. Most creatures have specific weaknesses you need to get through. Silver for corporeal undead or fiends, holy oil & holy water for incorporeal undead, adamantine for constructs, fiendsblood on your weapon for celestials. The spell Magic Weapon is an exception to this rule, because bypassing resistances is basically the whole point of that spell.
    
- In addition to its normal use, True Strike reveals something about a monster's weaknesses or strengths. When someone uses True Strike, I'll tell them "this creature is immune to physical weapons" or "this creature has high mental saves", etc. The spell has seen some minor use now.
    

  
  
  

Prestige Levels

The following prestige classes are listed in alphabetical order.

  

Brawler

Where other warriors equip themselves with swords and axes, you use your bare knuckles and a poor disposition to bring down your foes. You've mastered this unarmed killer edge through hand-to-hand bouts for prize money, pride, or freedom.

  

Prerequisites: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier

  

Skills: Choose one from Athletics or Acrobatics

  

Hand to Hand

Your body is a single deadly weapon, more dangerous and versatile than any sword or arrow. You gain the following benefits:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
    
- Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 5th level, 1d8 when you reach 11th level, and 1d10 when you reach 17th level.
    
- When you use the Attack action with only unarmed strikes, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
    

  

Thick-Skulled

When you are hit by a melee attack, you can roll a d10 and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

  

Clandestine Caster

Discretion is the better part of both valor and incredible arcane might. With some canny trickery, you've learned to hide your magic in plain sight, where you might pass as a mighty, but otherwise unremarkable warrior, until the moment when you have the upper hand.

  

Prerequisites: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

Hit Dice: 1d6

Hit Points: 1d6 (4) + your Constitution modifier

  

Skills: Deception

  

Spellcasting

This prestige level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it does not advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Clandestine Caster, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.

  

Invisible Cantrips

When you cast a cantrip that requires a spell attack roll, you can disguise its casting (including its spell components) and effects as if it were a melee weapon attack. To do this, you must be holding a melee weapon and must target a creature within 5 feet of you. You don't have disadvantage on this spell attack roll for a hostile creature being within 5 feet of you. The effects of the spell are completely invisible, appearing as if you instead delivered a mighty blow with the weapon.

  

Subtle Spell

You can cast a spell without any somatic or verbal components. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

  

Expert

Diligent research and practice has paid dividends. Through months of effort, you've mastered new crafts, honed your skills, trained in combat, or even improved your book-smarts.

  

Prerequisites: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier

  

Tools: One type of artisan’s tools

Languages: One of your choice

Skills: Choose any two

  

Expertise

Choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

  

Training

You gain proficiency in any three simple or martial weapons of your choice. Additionally, you gain proficiency in light armor. If you already have proficiency in light armor, you gain proficiency in medium armor instead.

  

Madman

Perhaps the strings in your mind have finally unraveled. Perhaps, they’re merely knotted. Maybe those strings are spaghetti, and you got hungry and ate all the spaghetti, and now you’re not really sure where your brain is. Now that you’re irrevocably insane, you have a unique, unhinged outlook that helps you see things other people miss.

  

Prerequisites: Have had one or more Indefinite Madness traits

Hit Dice: 1d8

Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier

  

Languages: One chosen randomly be the GM

Tools: One chosen randomly by the GM

Skills: One chosen randomly by the GM

  

Spellcasting

This prestige level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it does not advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Madman, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.

  

Lunatic Insight

At 1st level, whenever you make an ability check that doesn’t include your proficiency bonus, your unique insight allows you to make connections which may or may not exist. If the d20 roll for the ability check is even, you add your proficiency bonus to the check.

  

Already Insane

You have advantage on saving throws you make against effects which would charm you or cause madness.

  

Scoundrel

Whether you made some dastardly friends, discovered a love for illicit substance, or merely decided that the law shouldn’t stand in the way of making some coin, you’re in deep with the criminal underworld. You can probably keep your criminal ties under wraps, but you can’t stop looking over your shoulder, for fear that the authorities, or worse, your friends might come calling.

  

Prerequisites: Have joined a criminal organization

Hit Dice: 1d8

Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier

  

Tools: Thieves’ Tools

Skills: Deception, Sleight of Hand, Stealth

  

Thieves’ Cant

During your training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

  

Secret

When you gain this prestige level, choose one falsehood about yourself that you practice until you can recite it perfectly. This falsehood can be a single lie or an entire false history. You never need to make a Deception check for this falsehood.

  

Craven

When a creature you can see misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

  

Survivor

When it was all over, only you survived. Your close brush with death has robbed the reaper of its sting, and taught you a few hard-learned lessons about escaping death’s clutches.

  

Prerequisites: Survive a combat encounter with 1 hit point remaining

Hit Dice: 1d12

Hit Points: 1d12 (7) + your Constitution modifier

  

Relentless Survival

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

  

Breather

You can take a breather, a minute of downtime during which you compose yourself and mend your wounds. When you do so, you can spend one Hit Die, as if you finished a short rest. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

  

New Conditions

Some status effects are more likely to be encountered in the Feywild. The following effects should be formalized as Conditions when adventuring in the Plane of Faerie. Additionally, these effects can now be relieved by some or all of the spells lesser restoration, greater restoration, heal, and power word: heal, as noted in the Condition descriptions.

Dazed. A dazed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Any creature that is immune to being stunned is also immune to being dazed. Can be cured by all four restoration spells.

Hallucinating. A hallucinating creature gains the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, treats all ground as difficult terrain, and can never succeed on an ability check or saving throw against an illusion even if it would normally be able to discern the illusion through truesight or similar abilities. Can be cured by greater restoration, heal, and power word: heal.

Muted. A muted creature cannot speak or perform the verbal components of spells. Can be cured by all four restoration spells.

Shimmering. A shimmering creature is outlined in faint light. Attack rolls against them have advantage and they cannot benefit from being invisible. Can be cured by all four restoration spells.

Weird Arcana

Sometimes the turbulent magics of the Feywild will manifest as random effects. When that happens, you must roll on this table and apply the result. If the table requires you to cast a spell, it always uses Charisma as the spellcasting ability; any saving throw required by this table will be equal to 8 + the caster’s Charisma modifier + the caster’s proficiency bonus. You never need any spell components to cast these spells, you do not need to concentrate on them, and you cannot choose to end them before the end of their duration.

Drunkenness

  

Getting drunk happens in stages, as one circles the drain toward unconsciousness. Therefore, it is governed by a special condition known as drunkenness, which is measured in 10 levels. A drink can give a creature one or more levels of drunkenness, as specified in the drink's description.

  

     A creature immune to being poisoned can't become drunk, and one with advantage on saving throws against being poisoned has advantage on saves against becoming dunk as well.

     If an already drunk creature suffers another effect that causes drunkenness, its current level of drunkenness increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of drunkenness as well as all lower levels. 

     An effect that removes drunkenness reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all effects ending if a creature’s drunkenness level is reduced below 1.

     Each hour that passes reduces a creature’s drunkenness by 1 level. Moreover, finishing a long rest drops a creature’s drunkenness to 0. If the creature's drunkenness level was 5 or higher, they instead suffer the poisoned condition (as well as a blinding headache) for 4 hours.

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Level|Effect|
|1|A pleasant buzz fills your head|
|2|Passive Perception drops by 5|
|3|Coordination wanes: Disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks|
|4|Words slur: Disadvantage of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks|
|5|Poor balance: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|6|Speed halved|
|7|Attacks against you have advantage|
|8|Falling Over: Unless leaning against something, you fall prone at the end of your turn.|
|9|Vomiting: For 1 minute, you spend your action each turn retching. After this time, your drunkenness level drops by 1.|
|10|Unconsciousness, until the following morning|

  

Drinking Contests

  

Participants in a drinking contest take turns selecting drinks (or rolling for them randomly), which each participant must then drink simultaneously. Each drink has different Constitution save DCs and impose different levels of drunkenness on a failure. A participant is eliminated when they vomit or fall unconscious.

  

Nonmagical Drinks

The following beverages are distinguishable from potions, as they include no magical additives.

As long as you are wearing long sleeves, you can store up to 5 lbs. of items in each of your sleeves. Items stored in your sleeves are undetectable except by magic. Additionally, you can draw items from and stow items into your sleeves as a free action on your turn.

New Metamagic Options

  

The metamagic options in the PHB are only a small sample of the many ways in which sorcerers can manipulate the currents of magic. Below are some additional options that should open up exciting new possibilities for those talented souls.

  

Doublecast Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend 3 sorcery points to cast a second, different spell at the same target. The second spell must also target only one creature and not have a range of self. You must expend the appropriate spell slot for both spells.

  

Efficient Spell

When you cast a spell of 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th level, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to cast it using a spell slot one level lower than the spell's normal level, without changing the effects of the spell.

  

Liquid Spell

When you cast a non-instantaneous spell with a range of Self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 sorcery point for cantrips) to turn the spell into 4 ounces of drinkable liquid. You must have an appropriate container in which to store it. The liquid is then considered a potion, which grants the drinker the benefits of your spell for the spell's normal duration. The spell is treated as if it was cast by you, but you do not need to concentrate on it if it would normally require concentration. The potion loses its potency when you take a long rest.

  

Non-lethal Spell

When cast a spell that reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can spend 1 sorcery point to knock the creature out, rendering it unconscious, rather than deal a killing blow.

  

Slippery Spell

You can spend 1 sorcery point when you cast a spell to make it unbreakable by the spells counterspell, dispel magic, and remove curse.

  

Switch Spell

When you are concentrating on a spell, you can use a bonus action on your turn and spend 2 sorcery point to change that spell to a different spell. The new spell must be of a lower level than the original, and is considered to be cast at the lowest possible level. If the original spell had a target, that target must still be valid for the new spell; for example, you cannot switch a spell you have cast on someone else to a spell with a range of Self. The new spell's duration is equal to whatever time remained of the old spell's duration or its standard duration, whichever is shorter. You cannot switch a spell more than once.

  

Transmute Spell

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change the spell's damage type(s) to any other type of your choice.

  
  
  

### Firearm Rules Redux

Variant Rules

Comments from the Finger: The old firearm rules weren't bad per-se, but the numbers could have been tuned slightly better. This time, I've done a frankly horrific amount of math to make sure that these firearm rules are perfectly balanced against regular weapons. Oh, and we did a bunch of modern guns as well.

     As before, the general idea of only adding your Dex score to attack rolls, not damage, is still in effect, since that gives firearms in general a very different (and very fun) gimmick at the table. Enjoy!

  

Firearm Variant Rules

  

Black powder represents a paradigm shift in the art of warfare, fueling everything from powerful siege weapons to concealable, handheld guns. In many campaign settings, these firearms supplant the traditional scheme of weapons, forcing arrows, swords, and battleaxes into obsolesce. They might even be commonplace, a staple tool for hunting and home defense.

     In other campaign settings, however, swords, firearms, and magic coexist equally. In these settings, since magic provides an alternative to their use, firearms are rarer and more imprecise, often requiring specialists like gunslingers to be truly effective. A setting of this type might seem very familiar, with some changes. A knight is just as likely to carry a handgun as a dagger, and infantrymen may shoulder rifles, rather than pikes, but adventurers still delve into dungeons for treasure, and castles still dot the landscape.

  

Damage Rolls with Firearms

Unlike other weapons, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a firearm unless otherwise stated.

  

Two-Weapon Fighting with Firearms

Unlike other ranged weapons, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with two light firearms. When you do so, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack, to a minimum of 1 damage.

  

Firearm Proficiencies

Characters in most campaign worlds will not have proficiency with firearms, but in settings with widespread firearms, characters gain the following proficiencies:

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Class|Proficiencies|
|Barbarian|Simple firearms, assault rifle, gatling gun, light machine gun, magnum, pump shotgun|
|Bard|Simple firearms|
|Cleric|Simple firearms|

|Ranger|Simple firearms, martial firearms|

Firearm Properties

All firearms produce a loud boom, audible out to half a mile. In addition, firearms require special ammunition and some of them have additional special properties.

     Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. 

     Automatic. When you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make two attacks with disadvantage instead. These attacks always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. These attacks use double the normal amount of ammunition.

     Concealable. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to hide this weapon.

     Foregrip. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. If used in two hands, its normal and long ranges double.

     Mounted. This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, vehicle, or other bracing mount. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is mounted, it can't be moved. It can only be used to make an attack while unmounted if held by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 15.

     Recoil. After you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, every other attack you make with it until the end of your turn has disadvantage.

     Reload. This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are not proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes an action. If you are proficient, you can reload it as a bonus action. Some weapons require longer to reload, even if you have proficiency, which is specified in the reload property. If reloading a weapon requires longer than one action, the weapon can’t be used to make attacks until reloading is finished. 

      Scatter. If you make an attack against a target that is within half this weapon’s normal range, you deal the damage value listed in parentheses instead of the weapon’s normal damage dice.

     Sighted. This weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 20 feet.

  

Special Ammunition

All firearms require special ammunition. Most firearms use bullets, but some require even more specialized projectiles. For example, cannons use cannonballs and all scatter firearms use shells.

|---|---|
|Ammunition|Cost|
|Bullet|2 sp|
|Shell|5 sp|

  

# Feats

Better Lucky than Good

Prerequisite: One ability score of your choice 8 or lower, Charisma 13 or higher

  

You may not be the best at everything you do, but you've gotten pretty good at riding your luck, which is almost, but not quite, a skill in its own right. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Charisma score increases by 1.
    
- When you fail a ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can reroll that check, taking the second result. Once you use this ability, you must take a long rest before you can do so again.
    
- Whenever you make an ability check for an ability with a score of 8 or lower, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of that ability's modifier.
    

  

Feel No Pain

Prerequisite: Constitution 15 or higher, Wisdom 8 or lower

  

Some people wonder whether you're really physically tough, or if you're just too oblivious to notice you've been wounded. Who needs mental fortitude when you've got a skull thick enough to stop evil magic! You gain the following benefits:

- Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d6, to a minimum of 1 damage.
    
- You have advantage on any saving throw you make against being charmed.
    

  

Lithe Gymnast

Prerequisite: Strength 10 or lower, Dexterity 13 or higher

  

Your skinny frame is perfect for squeezing into tight spaces and performing acrobatics at high speed. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
    
- You can squeeze through spaces one size category smaller than you without suffering any penalties.
    
- If you spend 1 minute stretching and limbering up, you can gain advantage on one Strength check that happens within the next minute.
    
- As a reaction when you are knocked prone, you can immediately stand back up.
    

  

Lovable [[Klutz]]

Prerequisite: Dexterity 8 or lower, Charisma 13 or higher

- Any creature that makes a melee attacks against you while you are prone does not gain advantage, and you can stand from being prone without using any movement.
    
- Whenever you roll 10 or less on an ability check or attack roll on your turn, you can use your bonus action to gain some forgiveness. The next attack roll made against you before the beginning of your next turn has disadvantage.
    
- You can take the Use an Object action on your turn to break one non-magical, manufactured object you are touching. The object cannot be larger than 5 feet in any dimension.
    
- People forgive you quickly for your mistakes. You have advantage on any Charisma check that you make to gain favor with a creature you've accidentally wronged. 
    

  

No Presence

Prerequisite: Charisma 8 or lower

  

No matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to make yourself stand out from the crowd - sometimes even your closest friends forget that you're there! This can be turned to your advantage, though, when you don't want to be noticed. While you are within 15 feet of creatures that are not hostile to you, you can use your action to fade into the background, becoming invisible. This invisibility ends if you move, speak, perform any kind of action or bonus action except for Hiding, or if you interact with an object.

  

  

Short Attention Span

Prerequisite: Intelligence 10 or lower

  

You've always been kind of forgetful, and you have found that that isn't always a bad thing. You gain the following benefits:

- During periods of downtime, you can work as a performer (as a jester, village idiot, or similar role), even if you are not proficient in the Performance skill.
    
- If you are subject to an ongoing effect or condition that allows you to make additional saving throws against it at the end of your turns, you can use an action to forget about that effect, ending it immediately. Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again.
    
-   
    

Big Damn Hero

Prerequisite: good alignment

- When in combat against a creature that has a CR higher than your level, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.
    
- You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that has reduced one of your allies to 0 hit points in the last round.
    
- If a hostile creature you can see takes a legendary action, you can use your reaction to intercede, preventing the legendary action from happening. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
    

  

Cartoon Physicist

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
    
- You are immune to falling damage.
    
- You can carry any amount of weight without becoming encumbered.
    

  

Combat Pragmatist

The creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll and can't take reactions until the beginning of your next turn.

     You can use this ability three times and regain all expended uses when you take a long rest.

- When you and other creatures roll initiative and there are more hostile creatures than friendly ones, you have advantage on your initiative roll.
    
- When you make an attack roll against a target while none of your allies are within 5 feet of you or the target, you can reroll damage and take the higher result.
    

  

Ensemble Darkhorse

You are someone who takes special care to notice the contribution that everyone makes to your cause, right down to the most peripheral members of the team. This allows you to forge a special bond with your less prominent allies; each NPC hireling and follower you employ that does not have class levels gains the following benefits:

- Your ally's maximum hit points is increased by twice your level.
    
- Your ally can use your proficiency bonus in place of their own, if it is higher.
    
- Your ally gains proficiency with two skills of their choice.

Prerequisite: evil alignment

You are an intellectual, with sophisticated tastes and an enormous vocabulary. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- You can quickly switch out weapons, useful for striking on the run. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can draw a ranged or thrown weapon, make one or more ranged weapon attacks using it, then stow that weapon and draw a melee weapon.
    

  

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

     At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

     You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

  

Blitzwarrior

Prerequisite: Proficiency with simple firearms

Run and Gun

Prerequisite: Proficiency with simple firearms

On any turn in which you use your action to Dash, you can make a ranged weapon attack as a bonus action.

  

Spray and Pray

Prerequisite: Proficiency with martial firearms

When it comes to bullets, quantity often beats quality. By holding down the trigger and firing nonstop, you gain the following benefits:

Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or take the weapon’s normal damage. This action expends ten pieces of ammunition.
    
- You can use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when making attack rolls with a weapon that has the Mounted property.
    
-

However, while their best-selling brands are extremely popular among noble fashion aficionados, their lesser known products border on the physically painful to look at. This sponsor provides uniforms made of such a fabric to be worn by the team.|
|7|Magic Missiles, Mages, and More! Magical Quality for Mundane Prices. Though this chain of shops built its reputation on selling potions, scrolls, and magic items, it fills the rest of its stock with non-magical linens and such, which the everyday consumer typically finds much more appealing.

### Feats for Lovers

Feats

Notes form the Nails: happy Valentine's Day!

  

Feats for Lovers

  

Traditionally, earning feats is very much a solo accomplishment: a person gains experience or training, or awakens some power within themselves. On this day, however, we would like to offer something a little bit more... collaborative.

  Some of these feats are aimed at couples, and must be taken by two (or more!) people simultaneously to have an effect. You can choose to take one of these feats alone; if you do so, the DM should roll a d100; if the result is 99, a random creature somewhere else in the world has taken the same feat at that exact moment, and therefore shares the benefits of the feat with you. On any other result, your Charisma score is increased by 2.

  

Forbidden Love

Prerequisite: must be taken by two or more characters simultaneously.

For whatever reason, the love you share violates the taboos of your culture. You face a stark choice: continue to pursue your relationship in secret, or be cast out of your society - either way, one thing is certain: you are not giving up on each other! Characters who take this feat together gain the following benefits:

- When you take the Hide action while you are within 5 feet of a partner, both of you become hidden. Both partners must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, and you both use the higher result.
    
- As long as you are within 30 feet of a partner, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to lie about where you were or what you have been doing.
    

  

Forever Alone

You are doomed to never find true love. As a result, you are immune to being charmed and other creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern your thoughts, emotions, or motivations.

  

Friendship is Magic

Prerequisite: must be taken by two or more characters simultaneously, who can each cast at least one spell of first level or higher.

Love comes in all shapes and sizes, and sometimes a close friendship can be just as important as a romantic relationship. You have discovered that your bond with your companions is so strong that it actually enhances your magical powers. You gain the following benefits:

- When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a saving throw, a friend within 60 feet of you can use their reaction to add their own strength to the spell. All targets have disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against the spell.
    
- When you cast a spell as a ritual, you can work together with your friends to cast it faster. The casting time for the spell is equal to the normal casting time divided by the number of friends working on it.
    
- You can use an action to touch a friend within 5 feet of you and expend one spell slot of 5th level or lower to enable the friend to recover spent spell slots with a combined level equal to that of the spell slot you expended.
    

  

Not a Fighter

Some people love to fight, but you would be much happier if everyone could just get along. If you had your way, love would conquer all! You gain the following benefits:

- Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
    
- You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks against hostile creatures, or creatures that were hostile towards you at some point in the past 24 hours.
    
- When a creature is grappled by you, they cannot take the Attack or Cast a Spell actions.
    

  

Old Married Couple

Prerequisite: must be taken by two or more characters simultaneously.

You share an immensely deep understanding with your partner(s), as if you had spent your entire lives together. As such, you are perfectly synchronised, even if you do seem to be arguing all the time. Characters who take this feat together gain the following benefits:

- You can Help a partner as a bonus action as long as you are within 30 feet of them.
    
- You cannot be charmed or frightened as long as you can see a partner.
    
- If a partner is reduced to 0 hit points by a hostile creature, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until either you or it are reduced to 0 hit points.
    

  

Red String of Fate

Prerequisite: must be taken by two or more characters simultaneously.

You and your beloved are joined by an unbreakable bond that magically connects you, wherever you are. Characters who take this feat together gain the following benefits:

- You always know where your fated partner(s) is/are, regardless of where they are in the multiverse.
    
- As long as you are on the same plane of existence, you can communicate telepathically with your partner(s), regardless of whether you share a language.
    

  

Suave Lothario

Prerequisite: Charisma 13 or higher.

You are a master of seduction, you can bend the ear of almost anyone, drawing them to you like moths to a flame.

  You can targets one humanoid that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be charmed by you. The charmed creature regards you with adoration. They aren't under your direct control, but they take your requests or actions in the most favorable way they can.

  Each time you or your allies do anything harmful to the target, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on themselves on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until you die, are on a different plane of existence from the target, or end the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to your charms for the next 24 hours.

  You can have a number of humanoids charmed at a time equal to your Charisma modifier.

  

Tsundere

It's not like you like them or anything! ...Right? You gain the following benefits:

- You learn the vicious mockery cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
    
- When you are crafting items, you always seem to make too much. Whenever you create an item that has a quantity (such as a bundle of arrows or magical potion), you expend twice as many raw materials and make twice as much of the item per day than you would normally.
    
- You are adept at switching between aloof coldness and tender sweetness. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you have advantage on the first Charisma (Persuasion) check you make within the next 10 minutes.
    

# Tourney Rules

Variant Rules

Notes from the Nails: tournaments make great additions to a campaign. They're the perfect setting for high fantasy action, while also offering opportunities for political skullduggery and monster-free relaxation. Some credit must go to [this thread](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?535009-Jousting-Mechanics-Ideas) as well: thanks for the inspiration!

  

Tourney Rules

  

Have you ever wanted to feature a medieval tournament in your game with knights and jousting, but stopped yourself because the it'd be a pain to come up with new game mechanics to support it? WELL FRET YE NOT, FAIR MAIDEN, for I have done the hard work for you! Read on, and discover simple-yet-effective rules for running your very own tourney...

  

The Melee

  

The centrepiece of any tourney is the chaotic brawl known as the 'melee'. In this massive fight, where dozens or even hundreds of warriors fight it out with sword, axe and mace, combat is governed by strict rules of chivalry, and killing your foes is disallowed. Melee is divided into Free-for-All, in which the last contestant standing wins, and the Team contests, where warriors are split into two sides that engage each other in formation. Team melees, are further divided into mounted and dismounted battles - mounted fights are generally preferred by audiences, but may not be feasible if there is a shortage of knights or warhorses.

  

Rules of the Melee

In a melee, fighters must wield melee weapons, though thrown weapons such as javelins may be permitted. It is most unchivalrous to use lethal force in a melee (though accidents can happen) and anyone seen striking an opponent who is on the ground will be disqualified and ejected from the arena. Magic is usually restricted to magic items only, though some melees may allow spells with a range of touch or self to be used.

  

Fighters may voluntarily retire from a melee at any stage by taking an action on their turn to lay down their weapons and declare themselves out of action. Anyone who attacks a retired fighter will be disqualified.

  

Special Action: Eliminate

 You can perform this action on a prone opponent within 5 feet of you, as long as you are not within the reach of any standing opponents. When you take the Eliminate action, the target is immediately disqualified from the melee and must drop their weapons at the next opportunity and leave the fighting area by the shortest available route. Anyone who attacks an eliminated combatant will also be disqualified.

  

Running the Melee

Before the fight, determine the number of fighters (including the PCs) that will be participating. To calculate this quickly, you can roll 12d10 or 1d12*10 (minimum 40). Melee fighters will be a mixture of warriors; you may wish to use the knight, veteran, thug and berserker stat blocks to represent them.

  

Though the melee is large and filled with combatants, the players will only attract the attention of a few enemies at a time while many more fight and are eliminated elsewhere in the brawl. Therefore, the player's battle takes place within a 25 ft. x 25 ft. square area of the arena - one of many such areas - wherein enemy combatants routinely surge. If a PC exits this area while there are other combatants in the arena, they provoke an opportunity attack from a random combatant for every 10 feet they travel.

  

At the beginning of the melee, and at the beginning of each round of combat, roll 1d8. That many enemies enter the player's section of the arena on that round (provided there is space for them to enter at the periphery of the arena). This is called a Melee Round. The battle has a number of Melee Rounds based upon the number of fighters in the brawl. To determine the number of Melee Rounds, divide the total number of fighters by 2 (rounding down, if necessary), and continue dividing by 2 until the result is 1 or lower. The number of times you divided to reach this result is the number of Melee Rounds.

  

After the Melee Rounds are complete, the PCs still have to contend with the remaining combatants in the arena, possibly including each other, before the melee is complete.

  

Free-for-All vs. Team Melee

In a Free-for-All melee, all enemy combatants that enter combat on a melee round are hostile to the party, whereas in Team melee, only half are hostile, whereas the other half are friendly, and will fight alongside that party. Free-for-All melee continues until only one combatant is left standing, whereas Team melee continues until only one team remains.

  

Jousting

  

One of the most spectacular sights at a tourney is the thunderous crash of lance against shield that signifies a pair of knights tilting at each other in a joust. At a tourney, jousts are usually held as part of a knockout competition where winning knights advance through a series of rounds until just two finalists are left to compete for the prize.

  

Winning a Joust

Jousts are conducted as a set number of charges (usually 3), ending early if a rider is unhorsed and thus automatically defeated. If neither rider is unhorsed after 3 rounds, the winner is decided by points, with 1 point scored for each accurate hit on the opponent's shield and 2 points for each lance broken against the opponent. If the result is still a tie, the audience will vote on a winner. Local heroes, charismatic fan favourites and well-groomed horses have a clear edge if it comes down to a vote.

  

The Tilt

For each charge, initiative is determined by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Attacks are then made as normal against the target's AC, and any damage that would be dealt on a hit is instead dealt to the lance. Tourney lances have 10 HP and are replaced after each charge even if not broken. It should be noted that if the knight going second is unhorsed, they cannot attack, and they have disadvantage on their attack if they were struck but not unhorsed. If the initiative roll is tied, both characters attack at the same time and either or both could potentially be unhorsed. Characters with the Extra Attack feature cannot use it in a joust, but characters with the Mounted Combatant feat have advantage on the attack roll.

  

If a knight is hit, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to the damage rolled. On a failure, they are unhorsed. When a rider is unhorsed, they make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and are stunned for one round after falling. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the rider also suffers a random lingering injury as per the table on page 272 of the DMG.

  

Variant: Ring Jousting

A particularly noble and genteel crowd might object to the violence and danger inherent in regular jousting, preferring instead that the knights demonstrate their grace and finesse by spearing a series of hanging rings.

  In ring jousting, knights take turns to complete a course that features a number of set of rings. They have to choose whether to aim at the larger, smaller or medium sized ring from each set. The largest ring has and AC of 12 and is worth 1 point, the medium ring has an AC of 15 and is worth 2 points and the smallest ring has an AC of 18 and is worth 3 points. The knight with the most points at the end of the course wins.

  Knights must use their Dexterity instead of Strength to attack when jousting at rings.

  

Variant: Extended Combat Jousting

On the other hand, some crowds want to see blood. Jousting can be made much grittier and more dangerous by having the knights continue to fight on foot after one has been unhorsed.

     In these extended bouts, a mounted knight must dismount immediately when their opponent is unhorsed - it should be assumed that the horse moves 60 feet before the rider's next turn, though they can attempt to dismount halfway through this move as a reaction to seeing their opponent fall with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (on a failure, they fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage). They must then draw a melee weapon (usually a longsword or a mace) and continue the fight on foot until one of the knights yields or is knocked unconscious.

  

Sideshows

  

The melee and the jousting are the main events at a tourney. However, both of these events are relatively short-lived, and insufficient to occupy hundreds or even thousands of visitors for the duration of the show. Thus, an assortment of side-activities are laid on, such as the following...

  

Archery Contests

While competition in melee and jousting events is restricted to knights and nobles only, archery contests are usually open to all, including commoners and children. This makes them one of the very few means by which a commoner can come to the attention of powerful people - and even a modest cash prize is sure to generate lots of interest.

  Archery contests are usually organised as three-round elimination tournaments where archers are split into lines and the highest-scoring archer (sometimes the top two) from each line advances to one of two semi-finals. Then the winners of each semi-final face off one-on-one for the grand prize. In each round, the archers fire 6 arrows at a target 60ft away (though the range can vary - junior contests are usually shorter and grand finals often longer). Archers must use either shortbows or longbows; crossbows and other weapons are not allowed in archery contests.

  Points are scored according to the accuracy of the shot, determined by the archer's attack roll: 1 for white (AC 10), 2 for black (AC 12), 3 for blue (AC 14), 4 for red (AC 16), 5 for yellow (AC 18). When contests are held outdoors, there is a risk of sudden gusts of wind. The DM may therefore roll a d20 each round; all archers have disadvantage on their next shot if the result is a 20.

  

Best Dressed

Some tourneys have a prize for the best-dressed lord or lady. This can get just as competitive as the jousting, and the rewards can be just as big - aside from the winner's pot of cash, this is also an excellent way to attract high-class suitors.

  Commoners, that is, anyone without a Scroll of Pedigree, will not be considered for this contest but, once one is in contention, anything goes. The winner should be determined by combining three numbers into a total score: a) the cost of their outfit in gp, up to a maximum of 50, b) a Charisma (Performance) check, to demonstrate how well they carried off their look and c) an Intelligence (History) check, to represent how well the contestant is following the current trends and fashions.

  

Gambling

No tourney would be complete without a lively betting market! Jousting, in particular, with its clear winners, quick results and frequent upsets is perfect for gambling. If a player wants to bet on a joust between two knights that are not equally matched, odds should be calculated as follows:

  

1) Compare the knights' strength modifier. For each point of difference, give the stronger knight 1 'edge point'.

2) If one knight has the Mounted Combatant feat and the other doesn't, give the feat-holder 1 edge point.

3) If one knight has proficiency in Strength saves and the other doesn't, give the proficient knight 1 edge point.

4) Compare the edge point totals and note the difference. The one with more points is the favourite.

5) The underdog's odds should be X:2, where X is equal to 2 plus 1 for the first edge point of difference plus 2 for each subsequent edge point.

6) The favourite's odds are the inverse of the underdog's.

Worked example: Knight A has a Strength score of 20, proficiency in Strength saves and the Mounted Combatant feat. Knight B has 16 Strength and neither of those things. Knight A therefore has 4 edge points over Knight B. Knight B's odds are therefore set at 9:2 and Knight A's odds are 2:9.

  If a player bet 9 gold and Knight A, who then went on to win, the player would receive 11 gold back from the bookmaker.

Note that this calculation does not produce precise odds, nor does it take into account smaller factors like differences in the knights' proficiency bonuses or Animal Handling scores. Calculating precise odds is mathematically complex and, more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the average NPC bookmaker.

  

Magic Shows and Bardic Performances

When tourneys are held far away from the big cities, it is possible that large sections of the audience have never seen a wizard or bard in their lives. Therefore, it is not unusual for spellcasters to travel out to big tourneys in order to supplement their incomes. A PC with the ability to play an instrument or cast illusion spells can spend their time at the tourney entertaining crowds - and come home with a fistful of silver for their troubles. Performers can expect to earn an amount of gp equal to 1d8 + their Charisma modifier per hour, but spellcasters must expend one spell slot (of any level) for each hour of performance.

  
  

GUN RULES

### Firearm Rules

Variant Rule

Comments from the Finger: The West is getting weird. Think Swords, Sorcery, and Six-Shooters. These rules should help you include firearms in a campaign which also features regular weapons, without either group being over or underpowered. 

  

Firearm Variant Rules

  

Black powder represents a paradigm shift in the art of warfare, fueling everything from powerful siege weapons to concealable, handheld guns. In many campaign settings, these firearms supplant the traditional scheme of weapons, forcing arrows, swords, and battleaxes into obsolesce. They might even be commonplace, a staple tool for hunting and home defense.

     In other campaign settings, however, swords, firearms, and magic coexist equally. In these settings, since magic provides an alternative to their use, firearms are rarer and more imprecise, often requiring specialists like gunslingers to be truly effective. A setting of this type might seem very familiar, with some changes. A knight is just as likely to carry a handgun as a dagger, and infantrymen may shoulder rifles, rather than pikes, but adventurers still delve into dungeons for treasure, and castles still dot the landscape.

  

Damage Rolls with Firearms

Unlike other weapons, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a firearm unless otherwise stated.

  

Two-Weapon Fighting with Firearms

Unlike other ranged weapons, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with two light firearms. When you do so, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack, to a minimum of 1 damage.

  

Firearm Proficiencies

Characters in most campaign worlds will not have proficiency with firearms, but in settings with widespread firearms, characters gain the following proficiencies:

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Class|Proficiencies|
|Barbarian|Double-barrel shotgun|
|Bard|Light revolver, parlor gun|
|Cleric|None|

Firearm Properties

All firearms produce a loud boom, audible out to half a mile. In addition, firearms require special ammunition and some of them have additional special properties.

     Ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Firearms use bullets, scatter firearms use shells, and cannons use cannonballs.

     Concealable. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to hide this weapon.

     Mounted. This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, wagon, or other bracing mount. While it is mounted, it can't be moved. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is unmounted and the creature wielding it is not prone, this weapon can only be used proficiently by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 17.

     Reload. A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. If you are not proficient with the firearm, you must then use your action to reload it. If you are proficient, you can choose to use your bonus action to reload instead.

     Scatter. If you make an attack within half this weapon’s normal range, you deal an additional die of weapon damage.

  

Special Firearms

Firearms with special rules are described here.

     Gatling Gun. As an action, you can rapidly fire at an area rather than a single target. Select a 15-foot cube within the weapon's range. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if hit by this weapon's attack, or half as much on a successful saving throw. This action uses 10 round of ammunition.

     Light Cannon. An attack with this weapon can target a space within range, which is treated as having 10 AC. On a hit, each creature within 5 feet of the point of impact must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take half the damage rolled.

  

Special Ammunition

All firearms require special ammunition. Most firearms use bullets, but some require even more specialized projectiles. For example, cannons use cannonballs and all scatter firearms use shells.

  

Ammunition

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Ammunition|Cost|
|Bullet|2 sp|
|Cannonball|10 gp|
|Shell|5 sp|

  

### Siegeball

It's time we talk about Siegeball. People in every campaign world need some form of recreational past time, apart from killing monsters and going on quests, of course. Siegeball, a concept I stole /tg/ ([read about it here](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Siegeball)), was my go-to for campaigns set in 3.5. It's fun, violent, complements all kinds of characters, and makes clever use of existing game mechanics. However, the sport sorely needed an update for 5th edition, so I've taken it upon myself to simplify the sport a little and convert it over.

  

The Game

  

Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.

  

The Arena

  

The game is played in a walled rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 140 feet long by 45 feet wide (28 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team's tower, a 5-foot dimeter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 10 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. Towers have 25 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.

  

The Ball

  

Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though in some places, players strike the ball with their hands or fists, usually players are given bats (which use the statistics of a club), or even more powerful melee weapons, like warhammers and mauls.

  

The ball has an AC of 8 and a pool of Momentum Points, which determine how fast it's moving.

     Attacking the Ball. When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. On a hit, the ball gains a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt to it, rounded down. The ball moves five feet in the chosen direction for each momentum point it has. As it moves, the ball subtracts one momentum point for each five feet it moves until it stops.

  

The ball can collide with wall, objects, or towers.

     Colliding with a Wall. If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops.

     Colliding with a Player. If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball's current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to the ball's current momentum points and are knocked prone.

     If you do not use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.

     Colliding with a Tower. If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball's current momentum points and then stops.

  

Playing the Game

  

The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher attack roll successfully attacks the ball. Players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball, but need not begin on their own side.

  

Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the DM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hp.

  

Siegeball is a widely-played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only concrete rule of Siegeball is not to attack your opponent's tower directly. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn't stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, is tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.

  

In seedier games, Siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition. with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their side, while the players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on Siegeball range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cut-throat when fortunes are on the line. 

  

  

### INVESTIGATING LORE RULE

That Knowledge is currently beyond You, but, with an Intuition (a raw d20 roll) check, your character may be able to parse through their thoughts and have a Revelation.

Once per adventure,, you may make an Intuition check in hopes of having a Revelation.

Revelations occur on a Nat 20 or a Nat 1, with a Nat 20 Revelation being a Great success (give the player a helpful hint without giving away the twist), and a Nat 1 being a horrible Omen bound to become truth. (Such as an omen of a terrible horror, that may or may not become true within 24 hours. Examples: Ancient Dragon attacks the town while the party is away, burning it to the ground. Or, a cherished friend/guide of the party is kidnapped and held for a ransom [this is mainly for lower level players] )

Anything besides a 1 or 20 gives the PC a headache, making them unable to make this check again until a long rest.

It's an effective and creative custom/homebrew way to get the players who investigate EVERYTHING off your back...
