PREFACE

This conversion has been a labor of love of mine since 2015. Back when I was a fledgling GM, I undertook the foolish effort of attempting the first version of this overhaul, which was comically terrible. It featured four classes, which were just severely bastardized versions of their traditional 5e counterparts.

This version of the Player's Handbook, which is now officially complete, took me about two years and 2,000 or so hours. I've had some help from various sources (who have beeen credited accordingly), but for the most part this has come from mine own brain.

This book is designed to parallel the official D&D 5e Player's Handbook. It includes all the relevant chapters, reskinned to fit a Star Wars setting. The significant deviations are featured here.

WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

While this expansion utilizes the base rules of 5th Edition, there are significant differences that will be illustrated here, broken down by chapter. There is more information in each chapter, as per the SRD.

CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS

This chapter explains step-by-step character building, as exemplified by Han Solo.

CHAPTER 2: SPECIES

Races relabeled to species, all of which are brand new.

CHAPTER 3: CLASSES

There are ten classes. Berserker, fighter, monk, and operative are similar to their 5e counterparts. Scout is a heavily modified ranger. Engineer is based off artificer, but extrapolated to be a full caster. Guardian is based off of paladin, and consular is based off of sorcerer, with changes to better fit a force-wielder.

Sentinel is a reimagining of a bard, but as a 2/3 caster. Scholar is a brand new class.

CHAPTER 4: BACKGROUNDS

Backgrounds feature one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This helps players realize their characters in a more personal fashion.

CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT

Currency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced items, with rarities designed to mimic those of

Wars: the Old Republic. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than simply simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also utilizes a few houserules: light, medium, and heavy shields with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor, new weapon features, etc.

  

CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

New multiclassing requirements/proficiencies Spell point variant with different multiclassing

Fighting styles have been completely changed, with paired fighting masteries

Lots more feats

CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES

Generally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills.

CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING

Minor changes to better fit the galaxy at large.

CHAPTER 9: COMBAT

Lots of changes here: Two-Weapon Fighting with guns, Double-Weapon Fighting, damage type changes, and more.

CHAPTER 10:

FORCE- AND TECH-CASTING

There are several changes in this section:

Spells are now called powers.

Cantrips are now called at-will powers.

My own interpretation and simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.

Spellcasting has been separated into force- and tech- casting.

Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force Points, which regenerate on a long rest.

Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short rest.

While a character can have both force- and tech- casting, they are kept completely separate.

The number of known at-will powers and 1st-level and higher powers are no longer separate.

CHAPTERS 11 AND 12:

FORCE AND TECH POWERS

Chapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.

APPENDIX A: CONDITIONS

This appendix features most (all?) of the traditional 5e conditions, as well as a couple new ones of my own making.

APPENDIX B:

RECOMMENDED VARIANT RULES

This appendix features a number of variant rules I recommend.

INDEX

It's an index.

INTRODUCTION

HE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS ROLEPLAYING GAME IS ABOUT

storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make- believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.

This overhaul is designed as a Star Wars reskinning of the core DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS experience. The rules are generally the same, and so an experienced player of 5th Edition should have no trouble jumping right in to a Star Wars themed campaign. For the less experienced player, this Introduction will cover the basics of the 5th Edition of DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, appropriately reskinned for the setting.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike

  
  

of a Force-wielder's shock, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

In the Star Wars DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a planet-encompassing city like Coruscant, the wilds of Kashyyyk, or the war-torn expanse of Oricon. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle the legendary Jedi or Sith, and discover special modified items and other treasure.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the entrance to a Black Sun commpound, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they charge in, guns blazing? Convince the guardsmen they belong there?

Or use other means to find an entrance?

Then the GM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.

There's no winning and losing in any DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

WORLDS OF ADVENTURE

The many worlds of the Star Wars DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game are places of mysticism and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of science fiction and fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and mystery that make these worlds unique.

Naturally, this conversion is designed to explore the myriad worlds of the Star Wars universe. I personally designed it to be used in the Old Republic era as characterized by the Knights of the Old Republic games and The Old Republic MMORPG. Utilizing this timeframe allows greater justification for a prevalence of force-wielders.

All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and species, fantastic geography, ancient ruins, and scheming villains. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the Separatists' war on Ord Mantell. Ultimately they're all Star Wars worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.

Your GM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of Star Wars, you should check with your GM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Game Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a canon world.

USING THIS BOOK

The Player's Handbook is divided into twelve chapters. Chapters 1-6 are about creating a character,

providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game. It includes information on the various species, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in these chapters rely on material found later in the book. If you come across a game concept that you don't understand, consult the book's table of contents.

Chapters 7-9 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. It covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.

Chapters 10-12 is all about the Force and technology. It covers the nature of casting in the worlds of Star Wars, the rules for them, and the huge variety of powers available to characters in the game.

HOW TO PLAY

The play of the DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game unfolds according to this basic pattern.

1. The GM describes the environment. The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the cantina, and so on).

2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, "We'll take the east door," for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a container while a second examines a symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for enemies. The players don't need to take turns, but the GM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

3. The GM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious noble, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty rancor. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game.

Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

GAME DICE

The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent

100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions "1d3" and "1d2." To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it's a 2.)

THE D20

Does an adventurer's vibroblade swing hurt a rancor or just bounce off its leathery hide? Will the guard believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a Sith's force storm, or does he or she take full damage from the tempest? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.

1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability's modifier.)

2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a power, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).

Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.

ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7. This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play.

SPECIFIC BEATS GENERAL

This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many special traits, class features, powers, unique items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with sniper rifles, but every Chiss does because of a special trait.

That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally leap 30 feet, but some powers make that possible. The Force and technology account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

ROUND DOWN

There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater, unless the feature says otherwise.

ADVENTURES

The DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Game Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, special traits, equipment, and special items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.

The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Game Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the GM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a wonderous setting, whether it's an underground enclave, a crumbling temple, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs).

Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.

  

Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way.

Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a mystical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next.

Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to safety to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.

But that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.

THE FORCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Few Star Wars adventures end without interacting with a force- or tech-caster. Whether helpful or harmful, powers appear frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10, 11, and 12.

In the worlds of Star Wars, practitioners of the Force are uncommon, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent.

For adventurers, though, the Force and technology are key to their survival. Without the healing prowess of a Jedi or a sawbones, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting support of a scholar, soldiers might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer power and versatility of a consular, every threat would be magnified tenfold.

The Force and technology are also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of casters who are hell-bent on using power for some ill end. A mercenary leader subjugates the surrounding community, a renegade Sith saps the life from their victims, a vindictive droid takes over a space station with the intent of destroying its oppressors—these are just a few of the threats that adventurers might face. With power of their own, in the form of the Force and special items, the adventurers might prevail!

THE THREE PILLARS OF ADVENTURING

Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

EXPLORATION

Exploration includes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Game Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing the deserts of Tatooine or an hour making their way through the winding passages of an abandoned base. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character flipping a switch in a room to see what happens.

SOCIAL INTERACTION

Social interaction features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the least well guarded entrance to the mercenary base, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from the leader of a group of criminals, or persuading an informant to garner information about a distant location.

The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.

COMBAT

Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting powers, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by flipping a mysterious switch), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS

OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE

DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a species (such as human or twi'lek) and a class (such as sentinel or scout). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Star Wars galaxy.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking scoundrel, a fervent consular, or a cruel guardian. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny scoundrel who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like non-Human species like Twi'leks or Wookiees? Try building a character of one of those species. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don't know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Star Wars book to see what catches your interest.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these

steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.

Throughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it's a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Every character belongs to a species, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Star Wars worlds. The most common species in the galaxy is human, but there are a myriad of near-Human species available for play, including the four-armed Besalisks, the cunning Trandoshans, the dexterous Twi'leks, and the utilitarian droid. The Species chapter provides more information about these species.

The species you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's species grants particular special traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor powers.

These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the special traits of Lanniks make them exceptional consulars, and Jawas tend to be powerful engineers. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Ugnaught soldiers and Wookiee sentinels, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your species also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your species on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a city, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the Classes chapter.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities (including force- or tech- casting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.

LEVEL

Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you're starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see "Beyond 1st Level" later in this section).

HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE

Your character's hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you'll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character's hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see "Resting" in the Adventuring section). Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you add your Constitution modifier to the roll.

PROFICIENCY BONUS

The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet:

Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with Attack rolls with powers you cast

Ability checks using skills you're proficient in Ability checks using tools you're proficient with Saving throws you're proficient in

Saving throw DCs for powers you cast (explained in each force- or tech-casting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in "Using Ability Scores", tools in "Equipment.") Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally,

your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores chapter. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what species increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.

You generate your character's six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character's six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your species choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES

At your Game Master's option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are

above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.

4. DESCRIBE YOUR CHARACTER

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it's time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in the Personality and Background chapter, you can flesh out your character's physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character's alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. The Personality and Background chapter also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character's background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character's place in the D&D world. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in the Personality and Background section, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that's a more precise fit for your character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.

  

Ability Scores and Modifiers

Score

  

2-3 -4

  

6-7 -2

  

10-11 +0

  

14-15 +2

  

18-19 +4

  

22-23 +6

  

26-27 +8

  

30 +10

  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Take your character's ability scores and species into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick- fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what's going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

5. CHOOSE EQUIPMENT

Your class and background determine your character's starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section. Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of credits (cr) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. "Using Ability Scores" has more information on carrying capacity.

ARMOR CLASS

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.

Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in the Equipment section.

Some powers and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

WEAPONS

For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrorapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a vibrodagger, can use your Strength modifier instead.

6. COME TOGETHER

Most Star Wars characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Star Wars. Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.

BEYOND 1ST LEVEL

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

CLASS FEATURES AND HIT DICE

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

Character Advancement

  

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to

+4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

XP AND PROFICIENCY BONUS PROGRESSION

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.

CHAPTER 2: SPECIES

VISIT TO ANY OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE WORLDS OF

Star Wars overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.

And the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues-represent many different species, from diminutive bothans and stalwart cereans to majestic twi'leks and towering wookiees, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.

Scattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics: a hulking besalisk here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly chiss there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of jawas chatters as one of them activates a clever mechanical toy that moves of its own accord. Zabraks and devaronians live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone dros-a fugitive from the the Galactic Republic, trying to make his way in a world.

CHOOSING A SPECIES

Humans are the most common people in the worlds of Star Wars, but they live and work alongside ithorians, kiffar, mirialan, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.

Your choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a bothan can be a good choice for a sneaky operative, a wookiee makes a tough berserker, and a twi'lek can be a master of the Force.

Your character species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each species' description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and special alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their

species. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

  
  

SPECIAL TRAITS

The description of each species includes special traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

ABILITY SCORE INCREASE

Every species increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

AGE

The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

ALIGNMENT

Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your sith pureblood follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.

SIZE

Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.

SPEED

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

LANGUAGES

By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own.

Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the Star Wars universe.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Clak'dor VII

Language Bith

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.

The other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Bith are one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, "younger" species. Their society is highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.

NAMES

Bith names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple.

Male Names. Fedu, Jenkiss, Kabadons, Ph'teumkiass Female Names. Duhia, F'hubama, R'hothal, Thidus Surnames. D'intes, Hern, K'sarorn, Nimum, Rumo

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

BITH 

As a bith, you have the following special traits.

Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

Bith reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Biths' benevolent nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

Bith typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 120 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Detail Oriented. You are practiced at scouring for details. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks within 5 feet.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.

You are proficient in one musical instrument of your choice.

Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to computers, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Bith, and one more language of your choice.

Skin Color Brown

Hair Color Black, brown, or gray (with age)

Eye Color Brown or green

Distinctions Diminutive stature, mood-sensitive fur

  

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 4'3" +2d4"

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Bothawui

Language Bothese

  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Bothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards.

Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar'krai". When engaged in ar'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction.

NAMES

Male bothan names are often trickey while female's are soft. Surnames are familial.

Male Names. Garc, Hibriak, Nith, Tramom, Ventagt Female Names. Ceerriah, Dhaim, Gnam, Meenn, Vit Surnames. Bwif'livi, Gra'kit, Hia'faitu, Main'dil

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Cathar

Language Catharese

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

The Cathar have fur-covered bodies with thick manes as well as prominent, retractable claws that can deliver powerful killing attacks on foes and prey. Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.

The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt," in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.

NAMES

Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are usually one syllable.

Male Names. Crurbirr, Isyrr, Nynorr, Suro, Tukarr Female Names. Cuwin, Jyvohr, Mulahr, Solyri, Surnames. Jin, Ki, Mak, Rhir, Ta

Cathar reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Cathar tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

Cathar range from 5 to 7 feet tall, and can weigh up to 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

base walking speed is 30 feet.

You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. You can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Cat's Talent. You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.

You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Catharese.

CEREAN

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS

Skin Color Light tones

Hair Color Blond, brown, or white (usually with age)

Eye Color Yellow

Distinctions Cone-like skull, binary brain

  

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 5'8" +2d8"

Weight 120 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Cerea

Language Cerean

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

The Cereans' enlarged skulls, extending above their foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean's daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.

NAMES

Cerean male first names are often hyphenated, while females are not. Surnames are familial.

Male Names. Ji-Cheelia, Ki-Adi, Pick-toh, Sauli-Fanz Female Names. Dreash, Kilniavy, Melm, Rharoth, Surnames. Codux, Emkom, Kyureft, Lonnik, Mundi

  
  
  
  
  

As a cerean, you have the following special traits.

Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Cereans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Cereans' altruistic nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

Cereans typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Closed Mind. Cereans have a natural attunement for the Force, which makes them resistant to its powers.

You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.

You can choose to reroll Initiative checks, but you must use the new roll.

Perceptive. You have proficiency in Perception.

Strong-Legged. When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.

Trance. You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long

rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Cerean. Cerean is characterized by its gravelly sounds.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Csilla

Language Cheunh

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

The chiss are a near-human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.

NAMES

A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.

Names. Crorcu'ecuk'unist, Dash'esoru'ishur, Jerd'ecer'lonii, Kisk'egauw'eqhi, Marag'aliphil'eduo, Pommo'icuote'nlerme, Vornu'wuzi'lerdim

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Devaron

Language Devaronese

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life.

NAMES

Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.

Male Names. Cir, Gremegris, Keirtihk, Kucx, Niruhk Female Names. Crilnuy, Ghal, Milma, Nola, Taoluel Surnames. Breiz, Droddost, G'vaulnel, Raokt

BIOLOGY AND APPEARENCE

The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.

The duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.

With their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned

galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy.

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to "little bears," though they are sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.

Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.

NAMES

Ewok names are comprised of growled consonants. Female names always end in a vowel. Surnames are clan-based.

Male Names. Coostick, Erphek, Grarphil, Moodoo Female Names. Booshi, Chela, Fesasha, Lipe, Ypezzi Surnames. Fedrimra, Jellyng, Moomrack, Trantelaa

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Gamorr

Language Gamorrese

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Although a typical gamorrean is squat, green, and heavily built, not all shared these characteristics. Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown.

The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession.

NAMES

Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family.

Male Names. Ark, Blarrp, Blubrak, Cuab, Shos Female Names. Dabrisz, Mernoos, Ogreb, Tagorq Surnames. Doofnarq, Griks, Lurc, Poogmokk

Gamorrean Weaponry. You have proficiency with the vibroaxe, vibromace, and vibrosword.

When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

You can speak, read, and write Gamorrese. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it. Gamorrese is characterized by its grunts and squeals, and its writing is a crude, pictographic style.

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS

Skin Color Blue, brown, or green

Hair Color None

Eye Color Light colors

Distinctions Extendable tongues, long ears, eye

stalks, three toes, aquatic species

  

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 5'5" +2d10"

Weight 115 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Naboo

Language Gungan

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frog- kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.

If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders.

Homeworld Coruscant

Language Galactic Basic

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Humans are an intelligent species that originated on Coruscant, but can be found on many other planets across the galaxy, including Naboo, Tatooine, and Alderaan. They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as "humanoids" because of their structural resemblance to humans.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of humans with their own cultures, such as the Alderaanians or the Pamarthens. Humans are the most populous species in the Galaxy.

NAMES

Humans are the most populace species in the Galaxy, and thus their names vary drastically based on the planet or culture with whom they reside.

Male Names. Koth, Liorz, Satapak, Tin, Vuc Female Names. Dhetia, Jhilk, Risha, Thinnih, Tonu Surnames. Jauli, Kudi, Melmi, Windu, Wobec

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Defiant. Humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). You can use this before or after the roll, but before the GM determines the roll's outcome. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

You gain proficiency in one skill, one tool, and one weapon of your choice.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Ithor

Language Ithorese

  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Ithorians have two mouths and four throats, allowing them to speak in stereo. Female Ithorians have two humps on the back of their head, while males have only one. They have glossy, usually brown flesh. Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.

In addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians' four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Ithorians worship the "Mother Jungle," a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their "Law of Life."

NAMES

Ithorian names are quite varied in length but most names are soft and melodic. They are often difficult to prounounce by other species, so many Ithorians adopt nicknames.

Male Names. Del, Gizorthej, Pexxocl, Steorthibs Female Names. Binshe, Dhu'sha, Mul, Slosh, Vlo Surnames. Afleehl, Crukid, Tondand, Wamunn

  
  
  
  
  
  

As an Ithorian, you have the following special traits.

Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Ithorians reach adulthood in their late teens and live an average of 85 years.

Ithorians tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

Shorter Ithorians stand around 6 feet while taller reach over 7 and a half. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Hold Breath. Ithorians have a great lung capacity and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

Ithorians have resistance to sonic

damage.

As an action, you can violently expel air in a 15-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 sonic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain one use of this feature when you finish a long rest.

You can speak, read, and write Ithorese. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

JAWA TRAITS

As a jawa, you have the following special traits.

Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese.

Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.

The jawa's unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.

NAMES

Jawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their time around other species respond well to nicknames. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are clan based.

Male names. Bilvu, Mnak, Penk, Plin, Vih

Female names. Bahimos, Kola, Levu, Rhovi, Uvet Surnames. Kkejenem, M'avoe, Tjoteelt, Wiamoel

Jawas are considered adults when they make their first sale and live less than a century.

Jawas tendency to steal and swindle causes them to tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Grovel, Cower, and Beg. As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Tech Dabbler. You know the ion blast at-will tech

power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the repair droid tech power once per long rest. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the hold droid tech power once per long rest. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You do not require use of a wristpad for these powers.

Thieves. You have proficiency in Sleight of Hand.

Tinker. You have proficiency with tinker's implements. You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, cause a small electrical fire. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.

Undersized. Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.

You can speak, read, and write Jawaese. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.

Jawaese blends quickly spoken, semi-meaningless syllables with scents to be understood.

Weight 80 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Dorin

Language Kel Dor

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARENCE

Due to Dorin having a unique atmosphere composed of helium and a gas unique to their world, the kel dors are forced to wear an antiox breath mask and protective goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. Without their protective goggles, kel dors were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin. They were also able to survive in the vacuum of space for a short time, though it was unknown exactly how long they could withstand it.

The kel dors also have heightened reflexes, a result of the extrasensory organs in their heads. They are typically quick and wise.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Kel dors are noted for their simple approach to justice, and they typically see moral issues in black and white. On the one hand, the kel dor are noted for their hospitality; they would never turn away a stranger in need. Yet, kel dors are not averse to taking the law into their own hands, and have no compunctions about putting to death a thief who was merely stealing to feed himself.

Kel dor Force-sensitives are often trained as Baran Do Sages, who have an honored place in kel dor culture. They often serve as advisers to rich and powerful kel dor families. Wars and disasters have been averted simply by the insight of a Baran Do Sage.

NAMES

Kel dor names are base on sound generated by Dorin's unique atmosphere. Surnames are based on ancient family trades.

The mon calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the mon calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots designed for human-like feet. The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The mon calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy. Mon calamari literature depicts stars as islands in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated; once a mon calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. They often fixate themselves on "lost causes."

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Glee Anselm

Language Nautila

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Nautolans possess physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage make them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The society developed by the Nautolans on Glee Anselm is centralized around local families and governments. The centralized government of Glee Anselm is comprised of representatives from the Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful politicians as well as the most aged members of the society. A culture that promotes life-long mates, Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the household. Arranged marriages are not uncommon.

No cultural affinity for the Force ever developed on Glee Anselm, though members of the Nautolan species recognize its importance and respected those among them that were Forceful.

NAMES

Nautolan names are generally short and melodic. Female names usually end in a vowel. Surnames are familial.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Rodia

Language Rodese

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARENCE

The rodians are green-skinned humanoids from the planet Rodia. They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.

NAMES

Female names tend to be longer than male names. Surnames are familial.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Korriban

Language Sith

  
  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive.

Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society.

NAMES

Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.

Male Names. Aqorzum, Khashai, Sihmot, Wirjol

Aqurwia, Cliriu, Nupax, Ubhesosiuth

  
  

As a sith pureblood, you have the following special traits.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

You know the denounce at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the curse force power once per long rest.

When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the darkness force power once per long rest. Your forcecasting ability is Charisma for these powers.

You gain proficiency in the Intimidation

skill.

You have proficiency with saberwhips, vibrowhips, and nets.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 4'9" +2d8"

Weight 115 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Shili

Language Togruti

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARENCE

Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces, greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural surroundings.

Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.

NAMES

Togruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.

Male Names. Acanaar, Mukraas, Obolak, Tokrym Female Names. Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola Surnames. Hyl, Na, Nim, Ris, Resh, Vaal, Zin

Wild Hunters. You have proficiency with the Survival skill.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Togruti. Togruti is an ornate language characterized by trills and long vowel sounds which are modified by subtle tremors in the togruta's head-tails. This language is heavily influenced by Basic, but also incorporates some native idioms, which caused Basic- speaking togruta to use seemingly strange expressions.

Homeworld Trandosha

Language Dosh

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers.

Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.

NAMES

Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.

Male Names. Bossk, Tshyrrng, Varrsk, Wuikkekss Female Names. Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss Surnames. Dallosss, Druc, Groqisch, Hsac, Nausdot

  
  

TRANDOSHAN TRAITS

As a trandoshan, you have the following special traits.

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Trandoshans reach adulthood in their early teens and rarely live to be older than 70.

Trandoshans tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

Trandoshans stand as tall as 7 and a half feet and can weigh over 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

Trandoshans are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dosh. Dosh is characterized by its harsh grunts, hisses and growls, and its written form that used alphabetic glyphs.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Tatooine

Language Tusken

  
  

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

While Tuskens, also known as Tusken Raiders or Sand People, are easily recognizable by their full-body clothing, goggles, and mouth filters, little of their true physical appearance can be discerned. From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.

Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.

NAMES

Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds. Tuskens do not use surnames.

Male Names. Ur Ur, A'Koba, Qeruru'rr, Gr'Karr

K'Yark, Reirin, K'Orou, Ursarr'u

TUSKEN TRAITS

Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength or Charisma score increases by 1.

Tuskens are considered adults when they turn

15. Because of the harsh and unforgiving climate of their home world, they rarely live longer than half a century.

Tusken culture's violent focus and disregard of those outside the tribe causes them to tend towards chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

You are proficient in Survival. Additionally, you don't treat desert terrain as difficult terrain. Lastly, you are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Tusken Weaponry. You have proficiency with the slugthrower and vibromace.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Tusken. Tusken is a guttural language characterized by its barks, growls, and roars. While Tuskens typically understand Galactic Basic, it is rare to hear them speak anything but Tusken.

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Ryloth

Language Twi'leki

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARENCE

Twi'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.

NAMES

Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.

Male Names. Ecrizsati, Gaj'mogos, Ukelweko

Arag'mure, Oanicfuba, Unaecripi

## WEEQUAY

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS

Skin Color Brown, gray, red, or yellow

Hair Color Black or blond

Eye Color Black, gold, or gray

Distinctions Tough, leathery skin that provided

resistance to blasterfire

  

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 5'5" +2d8"

Weight 120 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Sriluur

Language Sriluurian

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.

Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.

NAMES

Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.

Male Names. Chublu, Fah, Kreakk, Og-Rollo, Yurrenn Female Names. Gila, Qommi, Palsa, Sex, Xelror Surnames. Britreg, Dlur, Klanz, Maub, Semu

As a weequay, you have the following special traits.

Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Weequay reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Weequay ruthlessness and greed cause them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

Force attuned individuals can detect the communication but can't understand it.

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male.

The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of "family" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."

NAMES

Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.

Male Names. Fubbodrrl, Gurrfupayyc, Kioerrr, Lavgaeffoak, Snrowbishutchuh, Zufiaarkaykkk

Female Names. Bulabba, Bonbaegnh, Hopakleupo, Keumnebheu, Onninh, Osstatiemmyock

  

## WOOKIEE

As a wookiee, you have the following special traits.

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Wookiees reach adulthood at about 40 and can live to be 400.

Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

Treeclimber. You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.

You can speak, read, and write Shyriiwook. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.

  
  

## ZABRAK

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS

Skin Color Pale to dark brown, red, orange and

yellow

Hair Color Black, blonde, brown, red, or purple

Eye Color Yellow, green, orange, brown, blue, red,

or purple

Distinctions Horns, two hearts, facial tattoos

  

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Height 5'1" +2d12"

Weight 120 lb. x(2d4) lb.

  

SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS

Homeworld Iridonia or Dathomir

Language Zabraki

  
  

BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE

Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.

In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.

Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do.

However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species' overall value throughout the galaxy.

NAMES

Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.

Male Names. Kadro, Muraa, Neqama, Ruvroo, Xadra

Blostopa, Mega, Novrar, Rebroke

  
  
  
  

As a zabrak, you have the following special traits.

Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.

Zabraks reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Zabraks stand anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Coercive. You have proficiency with Persuasion or Intimidation (your choice).

Crafters. You have proficiency with with one set of artisan's implements of your choice.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

Unarmed Combatant. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. You can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Zabraki.

  

# CHAPTER 4: BACKGROUNDS

  

CUSTOMIZING A BACKGROUND

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, a total of two tool proficiencies or languages, and a background feat from the sample backgrounds. 

AGENT

Many organizations active in the galaxy aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, mercenaries, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or items for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in

your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion

Languages: Two of your choice

Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr

FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN

As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

BACKGROUND FEAT

SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Agents are shaped by their experience in their faction's communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faction and their relationships to it affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some

hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

  
  
  

BOUNTY HUNTER

Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the

wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a

bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives - but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions. 

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth Tool 

Proficiencies: Your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit

Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 200 cr

FEATURE: EAR TO THE GROUND

You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.

CRIMINAL

You are an experienced criminal with a history of

breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the

criminal underworld. You're far closer than most

people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit

Equipment: A set of common clothes with a hood, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

CRIMINAL SPECIALTY

Individual criminals often have particular specialties, whether a part of an organization or a solo endeavor. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below. 

FEATURE: CRIMINAL CONTACT

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

ENTERTAINER

You thrive in front of an audience, knowing how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.

ENTERTAINER ROUTINES

A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines.

Choose one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.

- Dancer
    
- Jester
    
- Poet
    
- Storyteller
    

FEATURE: BY POPULAR DEMAND

You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or cantina but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the

establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

  
  

FORCE ADEPT

You are keenly attuned to the flow of the mysterious energy field known as the Force. With proper training, you could learn to consciously sense and manipulate that energy further. As it is, you may appear to have heightened senses, extremely quick reflexes, an intuitive understanding of others, or an uncanny ability to persuade people to your way of thinking. Your powers may have lain dormant for a long time,perhaps you felt something inside of you but never knew what it was. Perhaps your abilities were awoken by a strong encounter with another force-sensitive with the powers of the Force, or an object associated with the Force, such as a lightsaber.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion

Tool Proficiencies: Two of your choice of artisan's implements, gaming sets, or musical instruments

Equipment: A set of common clothes, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

FEATURE: GUIDED BY THE FORCE

When you attempt to learn a piece of knowledge, you often instinctively know where or from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a seemingly random person, book, or data file. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.

GAMBLER

You are a skilled gambler who spends most of your time in casinos, bar rooms, and gambling dens. Are your activities legal, or do you break the law? Have you ever cheated in a game, or do you play by the rules? No matter what, your life has been one of excitement, chance, and danger.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Sleight of Hand

Tool Proficiencies: Two types of gaming sets

Equipment: A set of common clothes, a set of dice, a deck of playing cards, a lucky charm, and a belt pouch

containing 100 cr.

FEATURE: LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING

You can convince nearly anyone to put up something they aren't normally willing to part with (property or information) in a game of chance. Your GM might rule that they will only agree to a game of their choosing, and they may only agree if they feel the odds are in their favor.

  

INVESTIGATOR

Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals.

Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Perception, and Survival

Languages: Two of your choice

Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 100 cr

FEATURE: WATCHER'S EYE

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

  

JEDI

You are a devout follower of the Jedi Order: an ancient, monastic peacekeeping organization united in its observance of the light side of the Force. A noble order of protectors noted for their ability to tap into the power of the Force, the Jedi serve as guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. You follow the Jedi Code:

"There is no emotion, there is peace.

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.

There is no passion, there is serenity. 

There is no chaos, there is harmony. 

There is no death, there is the Force."

Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion

Tool Proficiencies: Artificer's tools Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A copy of the Jedi code, a set of common

clothes including a robe, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

FEATURE: SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL

As a Jedi, you command the respect of those who are loyal to the Jedi Order. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at any Jedi temple, and those who support your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific Jedi temple and have a residence there. This could be the temple where you trained, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the Jedi for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

  

MANDALORIAN

You are a child of Mandalore. As a member of the most renowned warrior culture in history, your people are known for being strong and hardy. Mandalorian culture is built around the honor and glory that come from victory in battle.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Athletics, Intimidation, Piloting, and Survival

Tool Proficiencies: One set of artisan's implements Languages: Mando'a

Equipment: A set of traveler's clothes, a trophy from a previous victory, and a pouch containing 200 cr

MANDALORIAN CLAN

Choose an option or roll on the table below to determine your clan.

  

d8 Clan d8 Clan

1 Vizsla 5 Wren

2 Fett 6 Lok

3 Kryze 7 Cadera

FEATURE: CHILD OF MANDALORE

Other Mandalorians know, and will look out for you. If you're ever in need of a place to stay, or a meal to eat, other Mandalorians will help you as long as your clans aren't feuding. This could be in the form of shelters, meals, even healing. If the Mandalorians are of your clan or a clan friendly to you, they may be willing to help you even at cost to themselves.

  
  

MERCENARY

As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one.

Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.

FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE

You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little

about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the cantinas and feasthalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language, and if you spend at least an hour in such a location you can come across one of the following bits of information: a job offer, significant rumor, referral to a skilled merchant, blacksmith, etc., or a hint towards the pursuit of your current quest.

Additionally, you can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

  

NOBLE

You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with manual labor, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land.

Work with your GM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries, as well as your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, how do people regard them?

What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family or the head itself? Are you far down the line of succession? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces?

Does your family have a coat of arms you might wear, a signet ring, or particular colors?

These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of pedigree, and a purse containing 250 cr

FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and

people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

  

NOMAD

You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

FEATURE: WANDERER

You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.

  
  

OUTLAW

You are a notorious free adventurer who, due to unfortunate circumstances, has lost favor with the law. However, being of the common people, they protect you due to your just nature. A protector of the people, a thorn in the side of authorities.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, and Survival

Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A hunting trap, an iron pot, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr

DEFINING EVENT

Though you were once just a commoner, a specific event caused you to drastically change your lifestyle and take off for a life of dangerous wandering, or perhaps revenge. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as an outlaw.

FEATURE: NOTORIOUS

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you've shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

BACKGROUND FEAT

As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

PIRATE

You are an experienced pirate. Banditry and raiding are common in the Outer Rim, and little negative stigma is given to pirates. Those that prey on the Empire are sometimes even held in high regard as bold warriors. However, you still have contacts within the

criminal underworld and you're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of finer society.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, and Piloting

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit

Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps of Outer Rim worlds in your territory, a small piece of jewelry worth 100 cr from some exotic planet, and a pouch containing 50 cr

FEATURE: GALACTIC SCOURGE

You've been from one end of the galaxy to the other. You know the most lucrative trade routes. You have expert knowledge of the various hyperlanes. In addition to this, you know a large number of the models and designs of common space ships that are found in the galaxy. Further, the bonds you formed with your crew are strong, and you can call on their aid even if you've been away from their side for some time. You can expect your former comrades to offer you passage aboard ship, reasonable aid, or shelter when you are in need. Keep in mind that this bond goes both ways, and they may come to you expecting the same.

  
  
  

SCIENTIST

Nothing excites you more than pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Most of your time is spent in a lab performing experiments to further your interests. Few people understand the work you do. You can solve complex problems most people can't begin to wrap their heads around, and can solve simple problems in unexpected ways that surprise most people.

What is your scientific field of interest? Is it your insatiable curiosity, or a personal goal that drives you? Did you leave your lab voluntarily, or were you kicked out? One thing is for sure - there are too many interesting research ideas, and too little time.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Lore, Medicine, Nature, and Technology

Tool Proficiencies: One of your choice Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A set of common clothes, a datapad, a book on your field of research, a pouch containing 100 cr

FIELD OF RESEARCH

While scientist's are widely knowledgeable, they also choose a focus for their studies. Choose an option below to define your field of research.

- Artificial Intelligence
    
- Geology
    
- Arcana
    
- Medicine
    

 FEATURE: SCIENTIFIC METHOD

You are well acquainted with your field of research from having read numerous journals or having attended scientific conferences. Concepts that are complicated, involving technical jargon that usually goes over most people's heads, are simple to you. You fully understand concepts, can recall key information, and know how to use equipment related to your field, unless the research was hidden from the public, in which case you may only partially understand it. You also recognize well-known figures in your field.

  
  

SCOUNDREL

You have always had a way with people. You can tease out their heart's desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage. You know what people want and you promise to deliver, coaxing people into otherwise foolish decisions. You make the improbable sound

plausible, and come ahead on every deal.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Sleight of Hand

Tool Proficiencies: Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, a memento of a former con, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

FAVORITE SCHEMES

Every scoundrel has an angle they use in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table below.

- I shave creds or forge documents.
    
- I put on new identities like clothes.
    
- I convince people that worthless junk is worth their hard-earned money.
    

FEATURE: FALSE IDENTITY

You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.

Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

  

SITH

You are an acolyte of the Sith Order: an ancient order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side of the Force. Emerging as a divergent faction to the Jedi Order, the Sith are mortal enemies of the Jedi and fight against them. Driven by emotions such as hate, anger, and greed, the Sith are deceptive and ultimately obsessed with amassing power no matter the cost. You follow the Sith Code:

"Peace is a lie. There is only passion. Through passion I gain strength. Through strength I gain power.

Through power I gain victory.

Through victory my chains are broken.

The Force shall free me."

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Lore

Tool Proficiencies: Artificer's tools Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: A copy of the Sith code, a set of common clothes including a robe, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

FEATURE: ASYLUM BY THE FEARFUL

As a Sith, you instill fear in those who are aware of your standing. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at any Sith temple, and those who are aware of your nature will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific Sith temple and have a residence there. This could be the temple where you trained, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the Sith for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for benefits them and you remain in good standing with your temple.

  
  

SMUGGLER

You have spent your life hiding in the darkness, making shady deals behind closed doors. What led you to engage in a life of crime? Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything... for a price. Smugglers tend to be

more bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Piloting, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set and your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit

Equipment: A fusion cutter, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

FEATURE: CAREFUL SELECTION

Some close brushes with the law have taught you that not every city guard can be bribed, and some people are simply too keen to miss minute discrepancies. This feature allows you to study a person and gain insight into whether or not they would accept a bribe, or to pick up on whether they are exceptionally more perceptive than you. It does not reveal how expensive a bribe may be for a given situation, however.

SOLDIER

War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army, a

mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

When you choose this background, work with your GM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, a village militia, or perhaps a private company.

Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Athletics, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Piloting

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy, a gaming set (one of your choice), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr

SPECIALTY

During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

- Scout
    
- Medic
    
- Pilot
    
- Support Staff
    

FEATURE: MILITARY RANK

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments where your rank is recognized.

  

SPACER

Aboard a starship in the cold vacuum of space is where you feel most at home. You've spent the majority of your life travelling the stars. Life aboard ships has given you a good understanding of their inner workings. You might be especially skilled as a ship mechanic, a pilot, or support staff.

FEATURE: WELL-TRAVELED

As a spacer, you've been from one end of the galaxy to the other. You've traveled along many of the trade routes, and know the safest routes. You have expert knowledge of the various hyperlanes. In addition to this, you know a large number of the models and

designs of common space ships that are found in the galaxy.

  
  

  

# CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT

THE MARKETPLACE OF A LARGE CITY TEEMS WITH BUYERS AND

sellers of many sorts: Jawas peddling refurbished wares (or trying to steal from careless travelers), Ugnauts selling various technology scrap, Twi'lek armstechs and Mirialan synthweavers. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

Variant: Starting Wealth by Class

  
  

SELLING TREASURE

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

  

ARMS, ARMOR, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT

As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Used weapons and armor aren't always in good enough condition to sell.

  

ENHANCED ITEMS

Selling enhanced items can be problematic. Finding someone to find an overtuned blaster isn't hard, but the most unique of items are beyond all but the wealthiest denizens. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come across enhanced items to purchase. The value of special equipment is far beyond simple credits and should always be treated as such.

  

WEALTH

Berserker 5d4 x 100 cr  

Consular 5d4 x 100 cr

Engineer 6d4 x 100 cr  

Fighter 8d4 x 100 cr

Guardian 8d4 x 100 cr 

Monk           4d4 x 100 cr  

Operative 7d4 x 100 cr

Scholar 6d4 x 100 cr  

Scout           8d4 x 100 cr

Sentinel 6d4 x 100 cr 

  
  

GEMS, JEWELRY, AND ART OBJECTS

These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require

Wealth generally appears in the form of credits.Other trade goods, gemstones, artifacts, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the higher class often have wealth in the form of legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or a company, or the right to own land and raise armies .

  

CURRENCY

Credits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with incredible value. 

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. 

  

TRADE GOODS

In the Outer Rim, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—raw materials like bags of salt, livestock, and so on— retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

AT HIGHER LEVELS

As characters progress to higher levels, there is an expectation of increased wealth, be it in the shape of coins or equipment. The below table serves as a target for how much each character should have earned at certain levels.

  

ARMOR AND SHIELDS

  

ARMOR AND SHIELD PROFICIENCY

Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.

Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your armor class (AC).

  

ARMOR PROPERTIES

Many armors and shields have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table.

  

BULKY

While wearing armor with the bulky property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.

OBTRUSIVE

While wielding a shield with the obtrusive property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.

STRENGTH

While wearing armor or wielding a shield with the strength property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless you meet the strength requirement.

LIGHT ARMOR

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

COMBAT SUIT

Combat suits are seen all over the galaxy, and can be found for sale by almost any merchant who dealt in weapons and armor. The suit itself offers decent protection from most types of attacks while maintaining maximum flexibility and minimum weight. However this armor is only recommended for light skirmishes.

FIBER ARMOR

Fiber armor is a type of armor that offers more protection than the lighter combat suit. Fiber armor is heavier overall than combat suits, and not quite as flexible, but many consider the trade-offs worthwhile. It is a good source of defense from physical attacks and light blaster fire.

  

MEDIUM ARMOR

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

MESH ARMOR

Providing solid protection for a minimal cost, mesh armor is considered excellent protection for entrenched troops or guards. However, this protection comes at a cost of mobility, limiting its uses by rapidly advancing infantry. Still, it provides more mobility than battle armor.

WEAVE ARMOR

Weave armor was constructed from a mesh of metal, ceramic or composite plates and a padded jumpsuit. Variants of the armor included less plates and more padding for a lighter, though less protective armor, and heavier plating with molded pieces to fit the

wearer. Though the armor was available unmodified, most users personalized their armor.

COMPOSITE ARMOR

Composite armor is a type of armored suit that offers a good balance of mobility and protection against most types of weapons. The micro-hydraulics of this type of powered armor provide the operator with protection, but are more bulky than mesh or weave armors. 

HEAVY ARMOR

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

BATTLE ARMOR

Battle armor is an armor that reduces weight, but restricts movement. 

ASSAULT ARMOR

Assault armor improved on battle armor, with the benefit of micro-hydraulics that boost the efficacy of the operator. It offers better protection, but increased weight.

HEAVY EXOSKELETON

Heavy exoskeletons are virtually the heaviest armor acquirable during the Galactic War. It is ideal for extreme combat situations that involve direct damage and also offers a very good level of protection in sacrifice of dexterity. 

  

SHIELDS

Shields come in varying weights, sizes, and materials. Light shields are smaller and mounted to the forearm, while medium and heavy shields are held in hand. You can only benefit from one shield at a time.Shield generators are made almost entirely of energy barriers. Medium and heavy shield generators have a physical handheld component from which the barrier emanates; medium shield generators are orbs that are slightly larger than a fist, while heavy shield generators project from a large cross.

  

LIGHT SHIELDS

A light shield is generally affixed to the forearm. While a light shield does not fill the hand slot, you gain no benefit from it while the hand is full. You gain no benefit from a light shield while wielding a weapon with the heavy property.

MEDIUM SHIELDS

A medium shield is a common defensive technology that protects the user from blaster fire, the elements, or other hazards. Medium shields are used in conjunction with any one-handed weapon.

HEAVY SHIELDS

Heavy shields are much larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Their obtrusive size, however, makes them unwieldy, requiring the use of a one-handed weapon with the light property in the other hand.

### WEAPONS

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the galaxy, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. 

WEAPON PROFICIENCY

Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

  

AUTO

Automatic weapons can only fire in burst or rapid modes. If the weapon has both burst and rapid properties, you choose which mode to use. You can only use one mode at a time.

BURST

When you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the burst property, you can instead spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition equal to the burst number.

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage. If the targeted area is beyond normal range but within long range, affected targets have advantage on the save.

DEXTERITY

A weapon with this special property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement.

DISGUISED

You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a disguised weapon.

DOUBLE

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with Double-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

FINESSE

When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

FIXED

A weapon with the fixed property does not fill the hand slot, but you can't use the weapon while the hand is full. Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.

HEAVY

When you hit with an attack roll using Strength with this weapon, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1).

HIDDEN

You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

LIGHT

A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two- Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two- Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

LUMINOUS

A weapon with the luminous property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.

RANGE

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

RAPID

When you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the rapid property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal. If the target is beyond normal range but within long range, it has advantage on the save.

REACH

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach with it.

RELOAD

A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice). You must have one free hand to reload.

RETURNING

When you throw a weapon with the returning property, it automatically returns to your hand after the attack is complete, whether you hit or miss.

SPECIAL

A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

STRENGTH

A weapon with this special property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature.

THROWN

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

TWO-HANDED

This weapon requires two hands to use.

VERSATILE

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

SPECIAL WEAPONS

Weapons with special rules are described below.

NEEDLER

The needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.

NET

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.

TRANQUILIZER RIFLE

The tranquilizer rifle includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 4 shots fired by the weapon.

VIBRODART

Due to their diminutive size, vibrodarts make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.

VIBROLANCE

You have disadvantage when you use a vibrolance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

WRIST LAUNCHER

Rather than traditional power cells, the wrist launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of darts, small missiles, or specialized canisters.

MISSILE, FRAGMENTATION

This wrist launcher ammunition deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

POWER CELL

Power cells fuel blaster weapons that deal energy or ion damage. Additionally, power cells are used to energize certain tools.

PROJECTOR CANISTER, CRYO

When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a beam of carbonite energy in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

PROJECTOR CANISTER, INCENDIARY

When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a burst of flame in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

SLUG CARTRIDGE

Slug cartridges are ammunition for blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you reload a weapon that uses cartridges, you can reload any number of cartridges up to the weapon's reload number as a part of the same action.

RESPIRATOR

A respirator, or breath mask, is a portable device that allows an oxygen-breather to survive in low-oxygen atmospheres. Although not suitable for use in outer- space, these hands-free masks were essential equipment for deep-space travel that might require activity outside of a starship.

  

MEDICAL SUPPLIES

  

ANTITOXKIT

An antitoxkit contained a variety of wide-spectrum antidote hypospray injectors that were designed to neutralize all known poisons. A kit has five charges. As an action, you can administer a charge of the kit to cure a target of one poison affecting them or to give them advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to droids or constructs.

EMERGENCY BATTERY

All non-expendable droids need recharging as they are used. The battery has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a droid that has 0 hit points, without needing to make an Intelligence (Technology) check.

MEDPAC

A medpac is a quick-acting syringe filled with a concentrated dose of kolto. As an action, you can use this medpac to restore hit points to a beast or humanoid within 5 feet. The creature rolls one die equal to the size of their Hit Die and regains hit points equal to the amount rolled + their Constitution modifier (minimum of one hit point). If the creature has Hit Dice of different sizes, use whichever Hit Die size they have the most of.

POISON

As an action, you can use the poison in this vial to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

REPAIR KIT

A repair kit included the basic tools needed to repair a droid after being damaged in combat. The kit has three uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to restore hit points to a droid or construct within 5 feet. The creature rolls one die equal to the size of their Hit Die and regains hit points equal to the amount rolled + their Constitution modifier (minimum of one hit point). If the creature has Hit Dice of different sizes, use whichever Hit Die size they have the most of.

TRAUMAKIT

A common traumakit can be stocked with bacta packs, and contains spray-bandages, bone stabilizers, antiseptics, and other essentials for the treatment of wounds. As an action, you can expend a use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. A traumakit can be used to stabilize 5 times before it must be restocked at its original cost.

POUCH

A pouch stores 6 lb., not exceeding 1/5 cubic foot.

### UTILITIES

BINDERS

Binders can be used to restrain a Small or Medium creature with appropriate appendages. Applying binders takes an action, and the target must make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability to use). A hostile creature makes this save with advantage. Breaking the binders requires a DC 20 Strength check. Escaping them requires a DC 20 Dexterity check. A set of binders comes with one key. Without the key, unlocking the binders requires a DC 15 security kit to force open. Binders have an AC of 10 and 15 hit points. Destroying the binders frees the creature without harming it.

CHRONOMETER

A chronometer is a device that measures and keeps linear time.

FIELD RATIONS (ONE DAY'S)

Ration packs consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, and are used when other food is scarce. Each pack is divided into portions and can provide enough food for one person per day.

FUSION CUTTER

A fusion cutter is a handheld cutting tool popular among technicians. It cut through almost any reinforced material, given enough time. The internal power cell supplies an hour's worth of continuous operation.

GLOWROD

Glowrods create a beam of light illuminating the area around you in bright light for a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The glowrod lasts for 10 hours and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

GRAPPLING HOOK

A grappling hook allows a user to climb or ascend large objects. It can be mounted to a blaster, belt, or elsewhere. It has a 50-foot length.

HEAT GENERATOR

Heat generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal heat supply. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you are adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

HOMING BEACON

A homing beacon is a device used to track starships or any other entity being transported. Homing beacons transmit using non-mass HoloNet transceivers able to be tracked through hyperspace. Homing beacons are small enough that they can easily be hidden inside a ship, or tucked into some crevice on its exterior.

MACROBINOCULARS

Macrobinoculars are handheld viewing devices that allow users to observe distant objects. Some models are able to see into space from the surface of a planet.

RAM, PORTABLE

You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

RESTRAINING BOLT

Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit.

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

### WEAPON AND ARMOR ACCESSORIES

BANDOLIER

A bandolier is worn across the chest. It has 12 slots that can each hold a single item that weighs less than 2 lb, such as a vibrodagger, a fragmentation grenade, or a power cell. Once per turn, drawing an item from a bandolier does not require your object interaction.

BIPOD

A bipod is a device mounted to a two-handed blaster weapon to offer increased stability while prone. As an action, you can deploy or collapse the bipod. While deployed, you ignore the Strength requirement on ranged weapons with the strength property while you are prone, and your speed is reduced to 0. Additionally, while deployed and prone, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of the weapon.

FRICTION-GRIP GEAR

A special set of gloves and boots that allow the wearer to stick to and climb surfaces. While wearing these items, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and ceilings while leaving your hands free.

You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

JETPACK

Jetpacks are personal aerial transportation devices that allow the operator to fly into and through the air with great mobility. Activating or deactivating the jetpack requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The jetpack last for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or by replacing the power cells.

REMOTE DETONATOR

A small handheld device with a single button, used to activate explosives. Over the course of 1 minute, you can pair the detonator with up to two mines within 10 feet. As an action, you can remotely detonate all of the paired mines. You must be

within 30 feet of the mines to detonate them.

Stealth field generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute and can be recharged by a power source or by replacing the power cell. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.

TRACKER UTILITY VEST

A utility vest is a sleeveless item of clothing that includes several evenly-distributed pockets, popular among hunters, smugglers, and adventurers. The vest is made of leathery, hide material to resist rips, corrosion and water. The wearer can carry up to 10 light items (up to 1 lb each) without increasing their total encumbrance.

TRIPOD

A tripod is a device used to mount a two-handed

blaster weapon to offer increased stability. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the tripod. While deployed, you ignore the Strength requirement on blaster weapons with the strength property, and your speed is reduced to 0.

Additionally, while deployed, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of the weapon.

### TRADE GOODS

Trade is an essential part of the galactic economy. Many spacers make their living buying and selling goods along hyperspace routes that connect the galaxy's major worlds.

A merchant may be chartered by an individual or a corporation to deliver goods to a certain port, or move goods along a specified route. During times of war, opportunities abound in the shipping of ammunition and medical supplies. Some traders, seeking to earn a quick profit, may resort to smuggling illegal or restricted cargo on behalf of one of the galaxy's many crime syndicates. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

### DROIDS

One common way to spend wealth is to purchase droids. Some droids are built for scouting, while others offer advanced skillsets. Protocol droids help communicate with foreign bodies, and combat droids can help supplement a budding force. The Droids table offers some choices for purchase.

  
  

Mounts and Other Animals

  

Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles

### MOUNTS AND VEHICLES

Mounts and vehicles are the two most common types of on-planet transport.

  

VEHICLES

Vehicles are more common on civilized planets than animal mounts. Vehicles do not have access to barding and do not require saddles. Vehicles vary greatly based on price, speed, carrying capacity, personnel capacity, and armaments (if any). Below are some base costs for standard types of speeders. Vehicles are governed by Piloting proficiency.

Self-Sufficiency

The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in cities, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to repair your equipment, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.

Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

  

SERVICES

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

## CHAPTER 6 | CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

PREREQUISITES

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a fighter who decides to multiclass into the consular class must have either Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

Multiclassing Prerequisites

  

Consular Wisdom or Charisma 13

  

Fighter Strength or Dexterity 13

  

Monk Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13

  

Scholar Intelligence 13

  

Sentinel Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13

  

EXPERIENCE POINTS

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a consular 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a consular.

HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a fighter 5/guardian 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a fighter 5/operative 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

PROFICIENCY BONUS

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/operative 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.

If a feature or feat allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

PROFICIENCIES

When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

Multiclassing Proficiencies

Consular Simple lightweapons

Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, one tool from the class's list

Light armor, any one skill, one tool from the class's list

Light armor, medium armor, all blasters, all vibroweapons, one skill from the class's list

Light armor, simple lightweapons, one skill from the class's list

  

CLASS FEATURES

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Extra Attack, Superiority Die, Unarmored Defense, and Force- or Tech-casting.

EXTRA ATTACK

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).

SUPERIORITY DICE

If you have levels in multiple classes that have superiority dice, you track the size and quantity of your superiority dice for each class separately, but you can use either classes' superiority dice to fuel the other classes' maneuvers.

UNARMORED DEFENSE

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

FORCE- AND TECH-CASTING

Your capacity for force- and tech-casting depends partly on your combined levels in all your force- or tech-casting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the force- or tech- casting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the force- or tech-

casting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

POWERS KNOWN

You determine what powers you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/consular 3, for example, you know 6 tech powers of no higher than 1st-level. As a 3rd-level consular, you know 11 force powers of no higher than 2nd-level.

Each power you know is associated with one of your classes, and you use the force- or tech-casting ability of that class when you cast the power.

FORCE AND TECH POINTS

You determine your available force or tech points by adding together the amount given by each class, but you only add your casting modifier once.

If you have both force and tech points, you keep your pools separate, and they can only be used to fuel force or tech powers, respectively.

MAX POWER LEVEL

When multiclassing, you determine your Max Power Level by dividing each class's potential Max Power Level by 9, multiplying the result by the number of levels in that class, adding the results for each class together (rounding down the final result), and consulting the Multiclass Max Power Level table below.

For instance, if you have four levels in Marauder Approach berserker (1.77) and three levels in guardian (1.67), you count as a 3rd-level character when determining your Max Power Level, which is 2. While you don't know any 2nd-level powers, you can cast powers you know at that level.

If you have both force- and tech-casting, you determine your Max Power Levels separately, and they can only be used to cast force or tech powers, respectively.

Multiclass Max Power Level

  

Caster Level Slot Level Caster Level Slot Level

1st 1st 11th 6th

2nd 1st 12th 6th

3rd 2nd 13th 7th

4th 2nd 14th 7th

5th 3rd 15th 8th

6th 3rd 16th 8th

7th 4th 17th 9th

8th 4th 18th 9th

9th 5th 19th 9th

10th 5th 20th 9th

  

HIGH-LEVEL CASTING

When determining the number of higher level powers you can cast before needing a long rest, consult the rules for casting in the class in which you have the most levels.

CHAPTER 6 | CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS 192

FEATS

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse— you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.

You can't be surprised while you are conscious. Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.

When you roll a 19 or a 20 on the d20 for a death saving throw, you regain 1 hit point.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you've used this ability, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

BOUNTIFUL LUCK

4th level

Lucky feat

Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to lend to your companions when you see them falter. You're not sure how you do it; you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!

When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend 1 luck point to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll.

When you use this ability, you can't use luck points before the end of your next turn.

BRAWNY

You become stronger, gaining the following benefits:

If you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you say, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter.

CRAFTER

You have a knack for crafting; you work with greater efficiency and produce goods of higher quality. Select one type of artisan's implements. You gain the following benefits:

Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

You gain proficiency with the chosen tool. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.

When you craft something with the chosen tool, the total market value you can craft increases 50 cr per day. If you have expertise with it, the market value instead increases by 100 cr per day.

If you use the tool you've selected to practice a profession during downtime, you can support a lifestyle one higher than you would normally be able to.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different set of artisan's implements.

DUNGEON DELVER

Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:

On a success, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability

modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.

ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also

encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have

scores as high as 20, and monsters and villains can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to

+10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of

possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated

scores.

ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Sometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi's

Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability

check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers.

Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's

personality, ideals, or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

209 CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES

PROFICIENCY BONUS

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency

bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved. for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or

divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your

proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the Lore skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (Lore) checks.

In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

EXPERTISE

Certain features, such as the Expertise class feature or Ace Pilot feat, let you double your proficiency bonus with a given skill or tool proficiency, granting expertise in that skill or tool. As usual, you can only gain

expertise in a skill or tool once.

ABILITY CHECKS

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a

challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a

character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the 4 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the

difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the

total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes

the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the char- acter or monster makes no progress

toward the objective or makes progr- ess combined with a setback

determined by the GM.

  

CONTESTS

Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when

both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also

applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two

checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from

succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one

contestant might win the contest by default. If two

characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the

door remains shut.

CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES 210

SKILLS

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities,

including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's

starting skill proficiencies are determined at character

~ creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a

character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these

aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,

Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a

character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

Strength: Athletics

Dexterity: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth Intelligence: Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, Technology

Wisdom: Animal handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival

Charisma: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, "Make a Wisdom (Perception) check." At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a

check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to

ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff. the Dungeon Master might ask for a

Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that

proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

  

VARIANT: SKILLS WITH OTHER ABILITIES

Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a

specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual

combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.

So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your

proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.

Similarly, when your trandoshan berserker uses a

display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

PASSIVE CHECKS

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can

represent the average result for a task done

repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to

secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a

hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

For example. if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a

passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the "Dexterity" section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

211 CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES

WORKING TOGETHER

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an

ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9).

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with security kits, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover. a character

can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

GROUP CHECKS

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group

succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the

quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their

companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

USING EACH ABILITY

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

STRENGTH

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

STRENGTH CHECKS

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing,

jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.

You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.

  

You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick

seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

Other Strength Checks. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door Break free of bonds

Push through a tunnel that is too small

Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it Tip over a statue

Keep a boulder from rolling

ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a vibrosword or doublesword. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand—to—hand

combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

LIFTING AND CARRYING

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or

dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature'

carrying capacity and the amount it can push. drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

VARIANT: ENCUMBERANCE

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use

this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have

disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES 212

DEXTERITY

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

DEXTERITY CHECKS

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking

spaceship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a wallet off another person or slip something out of another

person's pocket.

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

Other Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent Steer a chariot around a tight turn

Pick a lock Disable a trap

Securely tie up a prisoner Wriggle free of bonds

Play a stringed instrument Craft a small or detailed object

ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged

weapon. such as a blaster rifle or bowcaster. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrodagger or techblade.

ARMOR CLASS

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5.

INITIATIVE

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in

chapter 9.

  
  
  
  
  
  

213 CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES

CONSTITUTION

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

CONSTITUTION CHECKS

Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks. because the endurance this

ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

Hold your breath

March or labor for hours without rest Go without sleep

Survive without food or water

Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

HIT POINTS

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit

points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you

adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to

reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

INTELLIGENCE

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

INTELLIGENCE CHECKS

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, and Technology skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the

appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient materials in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Your Intelligence (Lore) check measures your ability to recall information about the Force, artifacts, histories, and religions.

Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

Your Intelligence (Piloting) check measures your ability to control vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships. Piloting governs your ability to maneuver through tight spaces and debris fields or dogfight with enemy craft.

Technology. Your Intelligence (Technology) checks measure your ability to recall information about droids, vehicles, spaceships, aircraft, and computers, as well as your ability to interface with them. Technology can also be used to stabilize a droid or construct.

Other Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

WISDOM

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

WISDOM CHECKS

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine,

Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain

kinds of Wisdom checks.

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a

creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are

obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that rancors live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

Other Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow Discern Whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

FORCECASTING ABILITY

Forcecasters use Wisdom as their forcecasting ability for their light side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.

  

CHARISMA

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or

commanding personality.

CHARISMA CHECKS

A Charisma check might arise when you try to

influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

Your Charisma (Deception) check

determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This

deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a

Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance. acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use

persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include

convincing a Chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

Other Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip

Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

FORCECASTING ABILITY

Forcecasters use Charisma as their forcecasting ability for their dark side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.

SAVING THROWS

A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a power, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the

appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational

bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The operative, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies,

proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a

particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a power is determined by the caster's force- or tech-casting ability and proficiency

bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES 216

CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING

ELVING INTO AN ANCIENT SITH TOMB, SLIPPING THROUGH

the Black Sun territory of Coruscant, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the forest moon of Endor—these are the things that Star Wars

adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a noble court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the

book's introduction:

  

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the

adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.

The GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

TIME

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale

depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours time.

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Tatooine to Kashyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.

  

MOVEMENT

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a building corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope- all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through the forest and find the ruin entrance late in the evening of the third day." Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient Jedi stronghold. you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for

determining travel time depend on two factors: the

speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.

SPEED

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

TRAVEL PACE

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for more information).

The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour

column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).

For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual

distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger

distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in shuttles, speeders, or other vehicles

choose a pace as normal. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Travel Pace

  
  

Pace

  
  
  

Normal 300 feet  3 miles 24 miles

 Slow  200 feet  2 miles 18 miles Able to use stealth

  

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear enclosed corridors. But adventurers often face

dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered

difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you

can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

SPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking.

Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

CLIMBING, SWIMMING AND CRAWLING

While climbing, swimming, or crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a

successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

JUMPING

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or

chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot

immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that

distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump

costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics)

check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.

ACTIVITY WHILE TRAVELING

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the

wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

MARCHING ORDER

The adventurers should establish a marching order.

A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.

If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.

STEALTH

While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they

encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

NOTICING THREATS

Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the

characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the GM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while

characters in the front and middle ranks cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice

hidden threats.

If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.

  

If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for

danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not

watching for danger can do one of the following

activities instead, or some other activity with the GM's permission.

The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

Track. A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for tracking.)

The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for foraging.)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.

FALLING

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.

At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 kinetic

damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.

The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

SUFFOCATING

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it

drops to 0 hit points and is dying.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit

points.

VISION AND LIGHT

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in

combat, and targeting a power, to name just a few— rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light,

dim light, and darkness.

Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a

boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A

particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), or within the confines of an unlit

dungeon or a subterranean vault.

BLINDSIGHT

A creature with blindsight can perceive its

surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Miraluka, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses,

such as Togruta or Verpine, have this sense.

DARKVISION

Many creatures in the worlds of Star Wars, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that

creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

  

TRUESIGHT

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and enhanced darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual

illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by a power.

FOOD AND WATER

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the

character eats and drinks the full required amount.

FOOD

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.

Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a

day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

WATER

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who

drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with

access to less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the

character takes two levels in either case.

INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS

A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game.

The player tells the GM that his or her character is

doing something, such a moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything happens. For example, a

character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, open a door, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and powers. Objects are immune to poison and sonic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical attacks and powers much like creatures

can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves.

When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A

character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

SOCIAL INTERACTION

Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that

adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a Hutt so that he will spare your life. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don"t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).

In general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly

NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

ROLEPLAYING

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your

character thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.

DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH TO ROLEPLAYING

With this approach. you describe your character's words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.

For instance, Chris plays Tordek the Nikto. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the Black Sun for his family's misfortune. At a bar, an obnoxious Twi'lek

operative sits at Tordek's table and tries to strike up a conversation with the Nikto.

Chris says, "Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the Twi'lek, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the operative before ordering another drink."

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood and given the GM a clear idea of his characters attitude and actions.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:

Describe your character's emotions and attitude.

Focus on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.

Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.

  

Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Just

focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.

ACTIVE APPROACH TO ROLEPLAYING

If descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character's movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to

describe things that can't be reasonably acted out. Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying

Tordek above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, "I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams." In his normal voice. Chris then adds, "I get up, glare at the Twi'lek, and head to the bar."

RESULTS OF ROLEPLAYING

The GM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn Jawa refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain Hutt laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM's portrayal ofthe NPC's mood, dialogue, and

personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's

personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.

Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCS something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a senator's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.

ABILITY CHECKS

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the

situation. For example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM's discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a pavilion, the scoundrel who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage's release, the force initiate with Persuasion should do most of the talking.

RESTING

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their batteries and spirits for force- and tech-casting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

SHORT REST

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. Whenever a character spends a Hit Die to regain hit points, the player rolls the die and adds the

character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

LONG REST

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch, for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—fighting, casting powers, at least 1 hour of walking, or similar adventuring activity—the

characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one).

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its

benefits.

VARIANT: RESTING IN ARMOR

Resting in armor makes it difficult to recover fully. At the end of a long rest, if you wore your armor, you only recover one-quarter your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one), instead of half.

BETWEEN ADVENTURES

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and

prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as

crafting arms and armor, gambling, or spending their hard-earned credits.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a

certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has

been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events

beyond your perception stay in motion.

LIFESTYLE EXPENSES

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as

described in chapter 5.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be

consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new

downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to

spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

CRAFTING

You can craft unenhanced objects, including

adventuring equipment and works of art. While you don't need to be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's implements), without proficiency you will lack the knowledge of what objects you can create. You might also need access to special materials or locations

necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armstech's implements needs a workstation in order to craft a vibrosword.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 250 cr, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 250 cr, you make progress every day in 250-cr increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a heavy exoskeleton (market value 9,000 cr) takes 36 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the

characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each

character contributes 250 cr worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a heavy exoskeleton in 12

days, at a total cost of 4,500 cr.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 cr per day. If you have

expertise in your chosen tool, you can instead maintain a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 20 cr per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).

  

PRACTICING A PROFESSION

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 cr per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you

continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a syndicate or guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your

downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

RECUPERATING

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.

For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

RESEARCHING

The time between adventures is a great chance to

perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.

Research can include poring over dusty tomes and ancient datacrons in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 10 cr to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

TRAINING

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 10 cr per

day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

CHAPTER 9: COMBAT

HE SHRIEK OF BLASTER FIRE FLYING OVERHEAD. THE CLASH

of a gamorrean's axe striking against a composite shield. The crackle of lightning emenating from a Sith lord's hands. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat,

whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this

chapter, the rules address you, the player or Game Master. The Game Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. "You" can also mean the character or monster that you control.

THE ORDER OF COMBAT

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and force- or tech-casting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a

battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has

defeated the other.

SURPRISE

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a Mandalorian camp, springing from cover to attack them. Kath

hounds patrol down a hallway, leasher to their handler, unnoticed by the adventurers until the hound smells one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the

passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that

doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

YOUR TURN

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are

described in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

  
  
  
  

Combat Step By Step

1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.

2. Establish positions. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the

adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.

3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.

4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.

5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

The "Movement and Position" section later in this

chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "Actions in Combat."

BONUS ACTIONS

Various class features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a

bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an operative to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, power, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take

actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

OBJECT INTERACTION

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack, or you could grasp a two-handed weapon you are wielding in one hand with your other hand as you attack with it (releasing it requires no action).

If you want to interact with an additional object, you need to use your action or bonus action (your choice. Some enhanced items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it

presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM

could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

OTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN

Lastly, your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Certain special abilities, powers, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A

reaction, typically an instant response to a trigger of some kind, can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

MOVEMENT AND POSITION

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the

distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

The "Special Types of Movement'' section in Chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.

ACTIONS THAT GRANT MOVEMENT

If an action, bonus action, or reaction allows you to move as part of its effects, this additional movement does not count towards your speed. If it does not

require an action, however, it does count towards your speed.

  

For example, if a creature uses the Ataru lightsaber form, since adopting that form uses a bonus action, it does not count towards the creature's speed. A Path of Focus sentinel's Blade Dance feature, however, does

count towards it speed since it doesn't use an action.

BREAKING UP YOUR MOVE

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

MOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even

further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter with the Extra Attack feature who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

USING DIFFERENT SPEEDS

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move.

Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result

determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a flying speed of 30 and a walking speed of 40 because a Jedi cast the burst of speed power on you, you could walk 20 feet, then fly 10 feet, and then land to walk 10 feet more.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-

choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

BEING PRONE

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort, costing an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For

example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use powers that teleport. Every foot of movement while crawling

costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

MOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

FLYING MOVEMENT

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the

creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover.

CREATURE SIZE

Each creature takes up a different amount of space.

The Size Categories table shows how much space a

creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

Size Categories

Small 5 by 5 ft.

Large 10 by 10 ft.

Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger

  

SPACE

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium gamorrean stands in a 5-foot-wide

doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the gamorrean lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another

creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough

movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

  

SQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a

creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the

creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an

action that you improvise. Many creatures have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is

possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

ATTACK

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a vibrosword, firing a blaster, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack class feature, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

CAST A POWER

Force- and tech-casters such as consulars and engineers, as well as many creatures, have access to powers and can use them to great effect in combat.

Each power has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the power. Casting a power is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most powers do have a casting time of 1 action, so a force- or tech-

caster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a power. See chapter 10 for the rules on force- and tech-casting.

DASH

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your

speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

DISENGAGE

If you take the Disengage action, your movement

doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

DODGE

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you

can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.

GUARD

You can defend a creature within 5 feet of you. When you take the Guard action, you focus entirely on

preventing attacks from reaching your ally. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against the guarded ally has disadvantage if you can see the

attacker, as long as the ally is within 5 feet of you.

Additionally, if an attack would hit the guarded ally, you can instead have it hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.

HELP

You can lend your aid to another creature in the

completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next

ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally

attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

HIDE

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain

certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples

include "If the soldier steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the gamorrean steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a power, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the power's effect requires concentration (explained in

chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the knight speed power and ready shock, your knight speed power ends, and if you take

damage before you release shock with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

SEARCH

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

USE AN OBJECT

Many objects and items, such as grenades or medpacs, require your action to use. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object

action. If you would normally have to use your object interaction to draw the item you are using, you can instead do so as part of the Use an Object action.

MAKING AN ATTACK

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a power, an attack has a simple structure.

1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.

2. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In

addition, powers, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.

3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause

special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.

ATTACK ROLLS

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a

character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a creature is in its stat block.

MODIFIERS TO THE ROLL

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier

and the character's proficiency bonus. When a creature makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is

provided in its stat block.

The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability

modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.

Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some powers also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a power attack depends on the force- or tech-casting ability of the force- or tech-caster, as explained in chapter 10.

You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a power.

ROLLING 1 OR 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. In

addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

CHOOSING TO BE HIT

Sometimes, an attack might miss you when you wanted it to hit. You can choose to allow a miss to hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker

chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.

  

UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the force camouflage power, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you

automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

MELEE ATTACKS

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a

vibrosword, a lightsaber, or a vibrowhip. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few powers also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

When you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike. You are proficient in your unarmed strikes and, unless otherwise indicated, they do 1 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage.

OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly

past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to

make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something unwillingly moves you without using your movement, action, bonus action, or

reaction. For example, you don't provoke an

opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. However, you do provoke an opportunity attack if a power such as force jump, or an ally's Formation fighting style feature, causes you to move out of an enemies' reach, unless that feature says otherwise.

GRAPPLING

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled

condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check

contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

SHOVING AND TRIPPING

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature to push it away from you, or to trip a creature to knock it prone. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this

attack replaces one of them.

The target of your shove or trip must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check

contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either shove the target 5 feet away from you or trip it prone.

RANGED ATTACKS

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a blaster, hurl a vibrodagger, or otherwise strike a foe at a distance. A creature might have a natural ranged weapon. Many

powers also involve making a ranged attack.

RANGE

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a power, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a blaster, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has

disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a power, or some other means, you have

disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

DOUBLE-WEAPON FIGHTING

When you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon with the light and double properties while wielding it in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attack with the other end of the weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the attack roll of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

COVER

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are four degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective

degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three- quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with one-quarter cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has one-

quarter cover if an obstacle blocks at least one-fourth of its body, such as a thin pillar.

A target with half cover has a +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body, such as a low wall, a large piece of furniture, or another creature.

A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three- quarter cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a power, although some powers can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

DAMAGE AND HEALING

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&D. The thrust of a vibrosword, a well-placed blaster shot, or a shock of lightning from a shock power all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

HIT POINTS

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit

point maximum down to 0. This number changes as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

DAMAGE ROLLS

Each weapon, power, and harmful monster ability

specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Modified weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll— to the damage. A power tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a power or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when an engineer

casts explosion, the power's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

CRITICAL HITS

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll all of the attack's damage dice twice, including any additional damage dice, and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

Critical Hit Range. The critical hit range of a weapon determines on what d20 results a weapon scores a

critical hit. Typically, a weapon has a critical hit range of 1, meaning it only scores a critical hit on a 20. A critical hit range of 2, however, would mean the weapon

scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. A critical hit range cannot exceed 5, scoring a critical hit on 16-20.

DAMAGE TYPES

Different attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as

damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

Vials of corrosive liquid or the acid splash tech power deal acid damage.

Cold. The chill energy of carbonite and cryogenesis deal cold damage.

Energy damage is the damage dealt by

blaster weapons, lightweapons, and other powers or abilities.

The concussive damage of an explosion or an open flame deal fire damage.

Certain force powers that channel the pure energy of the Force deal force damage.

Ion damage is a special damage type that is most effective against droids and constructs.

  

Kinetic damage encompasses all physical damage commonly dealt by vibroweapons.

Lightning. The electrifying energy of the force lightning power deals lightning damage.

Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by powers like

death field, withers matter and even the soul.

Venomous stings and the toxic poison spray

power deal poison damage.

Psychic. The crippling agony causes by powers like

feedback deal psychic damage.

Debilitating noises cause sonic damage.

DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage

type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a

creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to lightning damage as well as resistance to all force

power damage, the damage of a force lightning is reduced by half, not reduced by three-quarters.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after passive modifiers to damage, but before active

modifiers. For example, a creature with resistance to kinetic damage, a proficiency bonus of +4, and the Defense fighting mastery is hit by an attack that deals 22 kinetic damage. The 22 damage is first reduced by 4 and then halved, so the creature takes 9 damage. The creature also has the Shield fighting mastery, and uses its reaction to further reduce the damage taken by 4, finally taking only 5 damage.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 8), and methods such as a benevolence force power or a medpac can remove damage instantly.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point

maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a consular grants an

operative 8 hit points of healing. If the operative has 14 current hit points with a maximum of 20, the operative regains 6 hit points from the consular, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until a power such as revitalize has restored it to life.

HIT DICE

Resting (explained in chapter 8), as well as certain special traits such as the trandoshan's Regenerative, consume Hit Dice to restore hit points. Whenever a

creature rolls a Hit Die to restore hit points, they add their Constitution modifier to the roll.

DROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following

sections.

INSTANT DEATH

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a consular with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18

damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining

damage equals her hit point maximum, the consular dies.

FALLING UNCONSCIOUS

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This

unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

DEATH SAVING THROWS

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by powers and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you

succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points (for example, by

catching fire because your limbs were all chopped off next to a pit of lava), you suffer a death saving throw failure.

If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead.

If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

STABILIZING A CREATURE

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or an Intelligence (Technology) check for a droid or

construct.

A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain

unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

MONSTERS AND DEATH

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player

characters.

KNOCKING A CREATURE OUT

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker

reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack or blaster weapon that deals ion or energy

damage, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the

damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT 230

TEMPORARY HIT POINTS

Some powers and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take

damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit

points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit

points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a power grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit

points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.

TEMPORARY FORCE AND TECH POINTS

Similar to temporary hit points, some powers, abilities, or features grant temporary force or tech points to a

creature. When you would expend force or tech points

—whether through a power, ability, or feature—the temporary points are spent first.

You can only have one source of temporary force or tech points. If you have temporary force or tech points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or gain the new ones.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary force or tech points has a duration, they last until they're

depleted or you finish a long rest.

UNDERWATER COMBAT

When adventurers pursue karkarodons back to their undersea domain, fight off gungans in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by a power) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a vibrodagger or vibrospear.

A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range, but functions normally against a target within normal range.

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

MOUNTED COMBAT

A trooper charging into battle on a dewback, an engineer casting powers from the seat of a speeder, or a consular soaring through the sky on shuttle all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can

provide.

An appropriately sized vehicle or a willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING

Once during your move, you can mount or dismount a vehicle creature that is within 5 feet of you. Doing so

costs an amount of movement equal to half your

speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a dewback.

Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.

Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

CONTROLLING A MOUNT

While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act

independently. Intelligent creatures act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated animals, such as

dewbacks or kaadu, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled

mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage,

and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. All vehicles are

considered controlled mounts, unless a feature says otherwise.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing

a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it

moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and

devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on

it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

## CHAPTER 10: FORCE- AND TECH-CASTING

AGIC EXISTS IN THE WORLDS OF STAR WARS IN THE FORM OF

powers. This chapter provides the rules for

casting these powers. There are two major sources of these power: the Force and technology. While multiple classes use the Force or technology to fuel their

powers, there are only the two sources. Regardless, powers follow the rules here.

WHAT IS A POWER?

A power is a discrete effect, a single shaping of the energies of the Force or a result of a technological formula, that creates a desired effect. In casting a power, a character carefully constructs the desired effect using the source of their power, and then releases it, all in the span of seconds.

Powers can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

A great number of powers exist, and over time many have been created and forgotten. An ancient force

technique may exist in a long-lost holocron, or a piece of Rakatan schemata may contain revolutionary tech.

POWER LEVEL

Every power has a level from 0 to 9. A power's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly

burst of speed at 1st level and the powerful greater explosion at 9th. At-will powers—simple but effective powers that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a power's level, the higher level a force- or tech-caster must be to use that power.

Power level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level power.

KNOWN POWERS

Before a force- or tech-caster can use a power, he or she must have the power learned, or must have access to the power in an enhanced item. Once a power is learned, it is always prepared. The number of powers a caster can have at any given time depends on the

character's level.

When you learn a power, either an at-will, 1st-level, or higher, you choose from the list of powers provided in Chapters 11 and 12. You can learn powers from any level up to your Max Power Level, including at-will

powers. The total number of powers you learn in this way can't exceed your Force or Tech Powers Known for your class.

If a power is granted to you by a class feature, that

power does not count against your powers known and you can't voluntarily unlearn it. If you already know that power, you may learn an additional power that is available to you.

Additionally, every time you learn a new power as a result of gaining a level, you can choose one of the

powers you know and replace it with another power of the same type, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.

FORCE AND TECH POINTS

Regardless of how many powers a caster knows or

prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of powers before resting. Manipulating the Force and

channeling its energy into even a simple power is

physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level powers are even more so. Thus, each casting class's

description includes a table showing how many force or tech points a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level consular Umara has 12 force points.

When a character casts a power, he or she expends a number of points based on the level of the power to

create the slot to cast it. At-will powers always cost 0 points, while casting a power at any other level costs

the power level + 1 points, as shown in the Power Level Point Cost table below. When Umara casts project, a 1st-level power, she spends two of her 12 force points, leaving 10 remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended force points, and finishing a short or long rest restores any expended tech points (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

When a caster casts a power using at a higher level than the power's normal level, the power assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara

casts project at 2nd-level, she uses three force points and that project is 2nd level.

Many powers have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as indicated in the Force Potency and Overcharge Tech sections of the power's description

Power Level Point Cost

  

Power Level Point Cost Power Level Point Cost

0 0 5 6

1 2 6 7

2 3 7 8

3 4 8 9

4 5 9 10

  

AT-WILL POWERS

An at-will power is one that can be cast without

expending force or tech points. An at-will power's level is 0.

CASTING FOCUSES

While forcecasting doesn't require a focus to cast force powers, techcasting requires that you have a tech

focus in order to cast tech powers.

CASTING A POWER

When a character casts any power, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the power's effects.

Each power description in chapters 11 and 12 begins with a block of information, including the power's name, level, alignment (for Force powers),

prerequisites (if it has any), casting time, range, and duration. The rest of a power entry describes the

power's effect.

POWER ALIGNMENTS

Most force powers are aligned with one of the

opposing sides of the Force—light and dark—while many fall somewhere in the middle—universal. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). Additionally, certain archetypes and feats offer benefits to using powers of a specific alignment.

PREREQUISITES

Certain force powers are built as more powerful version of previous powers. They require that you know the previous power before you can learn the new one, and you must retain knowledge of the previous

power to be able to cast the new one. If you are learning two or more powers at the same time, you can learn a power at the same time that you learn its

prerequisites.

For instance, to learn the knight speed force power you would first need to learn the burst of speed power, as indicated by its prerequisites.

CASTING TIME

Most powers require a single action to cast, but some powers require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

BONUS ACTION

A power cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the power, provided that you haven't already taken a

bonus action this turn. You can't cast another power during the same turn, except for an at-will with a

casting time of 1 action.

REACTIONS

Some powers can be cast as reactions. These powers take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a power can be cast as a reaction, the power's description tells you exactly when you can do so.

LONGER CASTING TIMES

Certain powers require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a power with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the power, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "Concentration" below). If your concentration is

broken, the power fails, but you don't expend force or tech points. If you want to try casting the power again, you must start over.

  

RANGE

The target of a power must be within the power's range. For a power like shock, the target is a creature. For a power like explosion, the target is the point in space where the explosion occurs.

Most powers have ranges expressed in feet. Some power can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other powers, such as the shield power, affect only you. These powers have a range of self.

Powers that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the power's effect must be you (see "Areas of Effect" later in the this chapter).

Once a power is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the power's description says otherwise.

DURATION

A power's duration is the length of time the power persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some powers specify

that their effects last until the powers are dispelled or destroyed.

INSTANTANEOUS

Many powers are instantaneous. The power harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.

CONCENTRATION

Some powers require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their effect active. If you lose

concentration, such a power ends.

If a power must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the power specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking,

doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

Casting another power that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a power if you cast another power that requires concentration. You can't

concentrate on two powers at once.

Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a power, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your

concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take

damage from multiple sources, such as a blaster shot and a force power, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a power if you are incapacitated or if you die. The GM might also decide that certain environmental

phenomena, such as turbulence on a ship or rocky terrain on a speeder, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power.

CHAPTER 10 | FORCE- AND TECH-CASTING 234

TARGETS

A typical power requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the power's effect. A power's description tells you whether the power targets

creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a power has a

perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a power at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a power says otherwise.

A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

TARGETING YOURSELF

If a power targets a creature of your choice, you can

choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a power you cast, you can target yourself.

AREAS OF EFFECT

Powers such as force storm and explosion cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A power's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the power's

effect erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some powers have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A power's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends

from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the power's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9.

CONE

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that points distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cones area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

CUBE

You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is

expressed as the length of each side.

A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

  

CYLINDER

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the power description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the power effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the

cylinder. The power's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

LINE

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line's point of origin is not included in the lines are of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

SPHERE

You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the

point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.

SAVING THROWS

Many powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a power's effects. The

power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your force- or tech-casting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

ATTACK ROLLS

Some powers require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the power effect hits the

intended target. Your attack bonus with a power attack equals your force- or tech-casting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Most powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated (see chapter 9).

COMBINING EFFECTS

The effects of different powers add together while the durations of those powers overlap. The effects of the same power cast multiple times—or identical effects from separate powers—don't combine, however.

Instead, the most potent effect~such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their

durations overlap.

For example, if two consulars cast guidance on the same target, that character gains the power's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice. Alternatively, if a character is targeted by both master speed and tactical advantage, they only gain the

benefits once.

Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100- foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

Fissures open throughout the power's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much

damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

  

### ENFEEBLE

At-will dark side power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

Dark energy courses from your hand at a creature within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. If it is missing any hit points, it takes 1d12 necrotic damage. Otherwise, it takes 1d8.

### ERUPTION

6th-level universal power

Prerequisite: Convulsion Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range.

Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 - foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 kinetic damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the power's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can

determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make a

Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Prerequisite: Improved Saber Throw Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 feet Duration: Instantaneous

As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged force attack with a lightweapon or vibroweapon against one target within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target takes 6d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against an additional effect depending on your choice of casting ability:

Wisdom. The target takes an additional 4d6 force

damage and it gains four levels of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its speed isn't reduced.

Charisma. The target takes an additional 4d6 necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its healing capability is unaffected.

The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.

### HALLUCINATION

2nd-level dark side power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You craft a dangerous illusion in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

The hallucination includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the hallucination with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force power save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an illusion, and the power ends.

While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that

spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.

### MASTER FORCE IMMUNITY

8th-level universal power

Prerequisite: Improved Force Immunity Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier

surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the

power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects. Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as force storm, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

 Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an unenhanced vibrosword.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Tech Override/Sever Force. Powers and enhanced effects such as sever force have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 force damage, or half as much on a success.

  

### WHIRLWIND

7th-level universal power

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot- radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point.

Until the power ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the power ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your force save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction.

### WILL OF THE FORCE

9th-level light side power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Instantaneous

You sublimate yourself before the will of the Force, attempting to use it to affect change in the galaxy around you.

The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other light side or universal force power of 8th level or lower.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.

You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the improved restoration power.

You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.

You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.

You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, will of the force could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10

necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast will of the force ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.

  

### WOUND

1st-level dark side power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You make a piercing gesture at a creature within range. Make a ranged force attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

  

### WRACK

6th-level dark side power

Prerequisite: Plague Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You wrack the body of a creature that you can see with a virulent, disease-like condition. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit

point maximum to return to normal immediately.

Force Potency. If you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the power deals an extra 2d6 damage for each slot level above 6th.

## CHAPTER 12: TECH POWERS

  

ABSORB ENERGY

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, energy, fire, ion, kinetic, lightning, or sonic damage

Range: Self Duration: 1 round

The power captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering

damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the power ends.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

  

ACID DART

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Duration: Instantaneous

A shimmering green dart streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the dart splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

  

ACID SPLASH

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You emit a burst of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

  

ACID WIND

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot cube) Duration: Instantaneous

You produce a breeze full of stinging acid droplets. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 acid damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't

blinded.

 Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

  

ACIDIC STRIKE

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in a thick acidic slime until the start of your next turn. Until the start of your next turn, if the target becomes grappled, or succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take 1d8 acid damage.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

  

ALARM

1st-level tech power

nute

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the power ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the power, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A silent alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

  

ANALYZE

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties

and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what tech powers, if any, are currently affecting it.

  

ANTIPATHY/SYMPATHY

8th-level tech power

our

This power attracts or repels creatures of your

choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

The power causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it.

While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

The power causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a

creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

  

This power benefits additional attacks at higher levels: two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th level, and four attacks at 17th level.

  

AUTONOMOUS SERVANT

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch

Duration: 8 hours, or until the end of your next short or long rest; whichever happens first 

You touch one Tiny, unenhanced object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and gains little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the power ends or the creature

drops to 0 hit points. See the stat block for its statistics. 

If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature affected by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the power persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

  

ASSESS THE SITUATION

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round

You take a sensory snapshot of a target within range.

Your tech grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. You have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this power, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a code cylinder, stand watch, or stack some small objects. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

The creature is considered a valid target for the tracker droid interface power. 

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

  

BACTA PACK

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: 1 minute

You create a luminescent pack of bacta in any space, occupied or unoccupied, within range. The pack remains in its space until it is activated by any creature you choose. If the space you choose is occupied by a creature you have designated, it can use its reaction to immediately activate the pack; otherwise, a creature within 5 feet of the pack can use a bonus action to touch it and activate it.

When the pack is activated by a designated creature, that creature regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your

techcasting modifier, and the pack is consumed. If the power ends before the pack has been activated, it becomes useless and disintegrates. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you may either increase the healing of a single pack by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st, or create another pack in a separate space, with one additional pack for each slot level above 1st.

  

BALLISTIC SHIELD

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A flickering blue shield surrounds your body. Until the power ends, you have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage.

  

BESTOW VIRUS

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a droid, construct, or a creature with a tech focus, and it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or receive a tech-based curse for the duration of the power. When you cast this power,

choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.

While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

While cursed, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.

While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target. 

A remove virus power ends this effect. At the GM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those

described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect.

Overcharge Tech. If you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th-level tech slot, the power lasts until it is dispelled. Using a tech slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require

concentration.

  

BUFFER

1st-level tech power

action

You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.

  

CAGE

7th-level tech power

action

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison

composed of energy springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any

powers cast into or out of the area.

When you cast the power, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that power to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the power or effect.

This power can't be dispelled.

  

CAPACITY BOOST

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You empower a blaster weapon you are holding. For the duration, you can reload the weapon once on each of your turns without using an action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns you can make one attack with the weapon.

CARBON FOG

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a cloud of icy fog in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see. The sphere extends around corners, and its area is heavily

obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain. Each creature that enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 4d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn. The fog lasts for the duration of the power or until it's dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 mph).

  

CARBONITE

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to freeze one creature that you can see within range into carbonite. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.

A creature restrained by this power must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the

petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while frozen in carbonite, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this power for the entire possible duration, the creature is frozen in carbonite until the effect is removed.

  

CARBONITE EXPLOSION

9th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 250 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Each creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is restrained for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a

successful save, the creature takes half damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn.

As an action, a restrained creature can make a Strength check against your tech save DC, ending this effect on itself on a success.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this power dies instantly, as its body shatters into frozen chunks.

  

CLOAKING SCREEN

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

COMBUSTIVE SHOT

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it ignites in flame. At the start of

your next turn, the creature takes fire damage equal to your techcasting ability modifier. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target, and the damage at the start of your next turn increases to 1d4 + your tech casting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 and 1d4, respectively, at 11th level and 17th level.

These caltrops pierce deep into the feet and boots of anyone who walks upon them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The caltrops are nearly invisible to the naked eye.

Any creature that can't see the area at the time the

power is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC to notice the caltrops before entering the area.

CONTINGENCY

6th-level tech power

minutes

Choose a tech power of 5th-level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that power, called the

contingent power, as part of casting contingency, expending tech points for both, but the contingent power doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two powers.

The contingent power takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

The contingent power takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency power at a time. If you cast this power again, the effect of another contingency power on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if your tech focus is ever not on your person.

An affected target gains 1 slowed level, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted. A creature affected by this power makes another Dexterity saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

Once this power has restored a creature to life, it cannot benefit from this power again until it finishes a short or long rest.

  

DELAYED EXPLOSION

7th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet

ion

You dictate a one-word command to a droid or

construct you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw

equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the power ends.

FABRICATE TRAP

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 hour Range: Touch

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this power, you create a trap that will later trigger in response to a certain condition. You must attach it either to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed or turned on (such as a book, door, or computer terminal) to conceal the trap. The trap can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. At the GM's discretion, certain actions may cause the trap to break or be rendered inoperative.

The trap is well disguised, and generally and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the trap when you cast the power, such as entering a certain area or powering on the object. You can further refine the trigger so the trap activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind (for example, the trap could be set to go off only droids or gungans). You can also set

conditions for creatures that don't trigger the trap, such as those who say a certain password.

You may only have one instance of this trap active at a time. If you cast another trap before the previous one is triggered, the other trap becomes inert.

When you create the trap, choose an explosive trap or a power trap:

You create an explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases

by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. 

When triggered, the trap erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trap. The

explosion spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trap), or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can store a prepared tech power of 3rd level or lower in the trap by casting it as part of creating the trap. The trap must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the trap is triggered, the stored power is cast. If the trap has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the trap. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the power requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trap increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a power trap, you can store any power of up to the same level as the slot you use for this power.

  

FIND THE PATH

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day

This power calculates out the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same planet. If you name a

destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a Black Sun lair"), the power fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same planet as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

  

FIRESTORM

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

Choose a point on the ground within range, 

incinerating everything in a 15-foot radius. All creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success. All large or smaller creatures are pushed to the edge of the power's radius. You may choose one creature to be at the very center of the firestorm, if you do so that creature has disadvantage on its saving throw and is knocked prone on a failure.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 6th.

  

FLAME SWEEP

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot cone) Duration: Instantaneous

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

  

FLAMING SHOTS

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You channel tech power through a blaster weapon you are wielding. When a target takes damage from the chosen weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The power ends when twelve shots have been fired.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the number of shots you can take with this power increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

  

FLASH

1st-level tech power

ion

You create a massive flash of light and explosion of sound at a point within range. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this power can affect.

Creatures within 20 feet of the point are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this power is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

  

FREQUENCY SCAN

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you can detect electronic transmissions. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose does not possess a commlink, or is not a droid or construct, the creature is unaffected. 

If the creature possesses a commlink or other communications device, you receive any transmissions it broadcasts or receives for the duration.

Additionally, if the target is a droid or construct, you can read its "thoughts." You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), and something that looms large in its mind (such as its current objectives). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target (or its pilot, if it has one) knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the power ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of droids, constructs, or creatures bearing communications devices you can't see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for transmissions within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts or transmissions for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range. 

  

FRIENDLY FIRE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You scramble the targeting protocols of nearby machines. Each droid or construct in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. If a construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

  

GLEAMING OUTLINE

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10- foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

  

GLIDE

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 30 feet of you falls

nute

One willing creature gains the ability to glide when falling. For the duration of the power, it falls at a rate of 30 feet per round and can move up to 30 feet horizontally as well on each of its turns. If the creature lands before the power ends, it takes no falling

damage and can land on its feet, and the power ends for that creature.

GREATER ANALYZE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Self

Duration: Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. This power gives you a summary of significant lore about it.

If the thing you named isn't known outside of one planetary system, you gain no information. The more information you already have, the more detailed the information you receive is.

  

GREATER EXPLOSION

9th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You expell a massive explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 40d6 fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one but remains standing.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

  

GREATER HOLOGRAM

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It appears at a spot you can see and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other sensory effects included. You can't create a sensory effect strong enough to cause damage or a condition.

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a creature learns it's an illusion, it can see through the image, and the other sensory qualities become faint to it.

Overcharge Tech. The power lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration if cast at 6th-level or higher.

  

GREATER LIGHT

3rd-level tech power

action

A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads from a point you choose. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from and moves with the object. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

If any of this power's area overlaps with enhanced darkness made by a power of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is dispelled.

  

GREATER SABOTAGE CHARGES

7th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six medium sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 10 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 4d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Overcharge Tech. The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

  

GREATER SALVO

9th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You launch four projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere of each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 15d6 fire damage and 15d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much

damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

  

GREATER TRANSLATION PROGRAM

3rd-level tech power

action

This power grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken registered language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one registered language and can hear the target understands what it says.

GREATER TRANSLOCATE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration, and then collapses. You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. On each of your turns before the power ends, you can use a bonus action to teleport in this way again.

  

GROUP HOLOGRAM

5th-level tech power

ion

This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.

The power disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

  

HAYWIRE

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You momentarily surround a creature you can see within range with electronic interference and holographic illusions. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or it takes 1d6 lightning damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

  

HOLD DROID

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a droid or construct that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid or construct for each slot level above 2nd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

  

HOLDING CELL

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shimmering energy springs into being and encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other power effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate power targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

  

HOLOGRAPHIC DISGUISE

1st-level tech power

action

Until the power ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you can disguise yourself through the use of a hologram emitter. You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a foot and change the appearance of your body weight, but you cannot change the basic structure of your body. The hologram can include your clothes, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person.

The illusion is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real size and shape of you. A creature can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC, seeing through the hologram on a success. 

  

HOLOGRAM

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes

location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

  

HOMING ROCKETS

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You lock on to one or more targets within range and expel a series of three small explosives. Each explosive hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. An explosive deals 1d4 + 1 fire damage to its target. The explosives all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the power creates one more explosive for each slot level above 1st.

  

ILLUSORY STRIKE

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you create an illusory duplicate of yourself in your space that only the target can see. The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you before the start of your next turn.

This power creates multiple duplicates when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, you create a second illusory duplicate, and the target has disadvantage on the next two attacks it makes against you before the start of your next turn. The number of duplicates and attacks with disadvantage increases to three at 11th level and four at 17th level.

  

ILLUSORY TERRAIN

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: 300 feet

Duration: 24 hours

You make terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of terrain.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

  

IMMOLATE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the power's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one. These enhanced flames can't be extinguished by unenhanced means.

If damage from this power kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

  

IMPLANT MESSAGE

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: 30 feet Duration: Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak

the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the message to play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

INCENDIARY CLOUD

8th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

  

INFILTRATE

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible. Anything the target is carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target. The power ends if the target attacks, casts a power, or otherwise take a hostile action.

Overcharge Tech. You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

  

INVISIBILITY TO CAMERAS

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to four creatures of your choice become undetectable to electronic sensors and cameras.

Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also undetectable, so long as it's on the target's person. The target is still visible to regular vision.

  

INVULNERABILITY

9th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A flickering blue aura shimmers into being around you. Until the power ends, you are immune to all damage.

  

ION BLAST

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You create a blast of ion energy. Choose one

creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 ion damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

  

IONIC BOND

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 30 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of ion energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained line between you and the target. Make a ranged tech attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 ion damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d8 ion damage to the target automatically. The power ends if you use your bonus action to do anything else. The power also ends if the target is ever outside the power's range or if it has total cover from you.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

  

IONIC STRIKE

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in an ionic discharge. If the target willingly takes a reaction before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d6 ion damage, and the power ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 ion damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking reactions increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level. 

  

JET OF FLAME

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (30-foot sphere) Duration: 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The power ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the power. When you cast this power, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tech attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

  

KOLTO CLOUD

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Instantaneous

As you expel kolto, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

  

KOLTO DISPENSER

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet (5-foot cube)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You establish a mobile first aid station that radiates kolto in a 5-foot cube you can see within range.

Until the power ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the station's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the station to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The station can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your techcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the station disintegrates. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the station up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd. 

  

KOLTO INFUSION

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of kolto energy washes over the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This power also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This power has no effect on droids or

constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.

  

KOLTO PACK

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Instantaneous

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

  

KOLTO RESERVE

4th-level tech power

ion

You touch a creature and grant it a small reserve of kolto. The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the power ends. If the power is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the powers ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

  

KOLTO WAVES

9th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

A flood of kolto energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this power are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

  
  

LIGHT

At-will tech power

action

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the power ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an

additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The power ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile

creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the power.

  

LOCK

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this power can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this power for 1 minute.

Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the

power is dispelled or suppressed. Casting release on the object suppresses lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this power, the object is more

difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

  

MAGNETIC FIELD

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a strong magnetic field around you in a 10-foot radius which moves with you, remaining centered on you. The field lasts for the power's duration.

The field has the following effects:

The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.

The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks which deal kinetic, energy, or ion damage have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the field.

Communications equipment cannot communicate into or out of the field.

  

MAGNETIC HOLD

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the power ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability affix itself to and move along any metallic surface. It can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, all while leaving its hands free, at its normal walking

speed.

  

MASS REPAIR DROID

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

Choose up to six droids or constructs in a 30-foot- radius sphere centered on a point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your techcasting ability

modifier. This power only effects droids and constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

  

MENDING

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This ability repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn strap, or a leaking cup. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

  

MINOR DEFIBRILLATION

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

You generate a static charge that can aid or harm a creature you touch. Make a melee tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 lightning

damage. If the target is a living creature that has 0 hit points, it immediately gains one death saving throw success instead of taking damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). 

  

MINOR HOLOGRAM

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet Duration: Up to 1 hour

This ability is a minor tech trick that creates one of the following effects within range.

You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.

You instantaneously light or snuff out a source of light. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

You create a trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you use this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

  

MIRROR IMAGE

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the power ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The power ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this power if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. 

  

MISLEAD

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a power.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

  

MOBILE LIGHTS

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four orbs of light within range that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this power, and a light winks out if it exceeds the power's range.

  

MOTIVATOR BOOST

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You imbue a willing droid with heightened speed and maneuverability. Until the power ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, and it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid or construct for each slot level above 2nd.

  

NEUROTOXIN

7th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 30 feet

based on its current hit points:

60 hit points or fewer: poisoned for 1 minute

50 hit points or fewer: poisoned and deafened for 1 minute

40 hit points or fewer: poisoned, deafened, and blinded for 10 minutes

30 hit points or fewer: poisoned, blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour

20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

  

OIL SLICK

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: 1 minute

You cover the ground in a 10-foot square within range in oil. For the duration, it is difficult terrain. When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.

The oil is flammable. Any 5 foot square of the oil exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each creature who enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

ON/OFF

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

This power allows you to activate or deactivate any electronic device within range, as long as the device is not being wielded by a creature, and has a clearly defined on or off function that can be easily accessed from the outside of the device. Any device that requires a software-based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be affected by on/off.

  

OVERHEAT

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a blaster or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the

object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the power. Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If an object is held, worn, or integrated, and a creature takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't—or can't—drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

  

OVERLOAD

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot cube) Duration: Instantaneous

You expel a burst of power. Each creature in a 15- foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 ion damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much

damage and isn't pushed.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. 

  

OVERRIDE INTERFACE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and attempt to remotely override itscontrols. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a

bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for the duration.

While the droid is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are on the same planet. Via your tech focus, you can use this link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Move over there," or "Fetch that object." If the droid completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the droid takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a 6th-level tech slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level tech slot, the duration is 1 hour.

When you use a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

  

PARALYZE CREATURE

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the duration. While poisoned in this way, the target is paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

  

PARALYZE HUMANOID

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the

duration. While poisoned in this way, the target is paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

  

PHEROMONE BURST

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (5-foot sphere) Duration: Instantaneous

You expel a burst of mood-altering pheromones around you. Each creature within range other than you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and become frightened of you until the start of its next turn. A creature that is immune to the poisoned condition is not frightened.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

  

POISON DART

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

POISON SPRAY

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet Duration: Instantaneous

PREDICTIVE AI

9th-level tech power

nute

You touch a willing creature, granting them a limited AI companion that can predict the world around them. For the duration, the target can't be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have

disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This power immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

  

PREPAREDNESS

1st-level tech power

PRESSURE CRUSH

At-will tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

You attempt to crush the body of a creature you touch. The target must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is grappled or restrained by you or an effect you control, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d12 kinetic damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

  

PROGRAMMED ILLUSION

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Duration: Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes.

This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it

disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

  

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

  

PROJECT HOLOGRAM

7th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 500 miles

Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

  

PROTECTION FROM ENERGY

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic.

  

PYROTECHNICS

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous 

  

REBOOT

At-will tech power

ion

Choose an area of unenhanced flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

  

RADIATION

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the power ends.

When a creature moves into the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 necrotic damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5- foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this power go away when the power ends.

  

READ MEMORY

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet

Duration: 10 minutes

You read the memory of an incapacitated droid or construct within range. The target must have its memory core (and/or other appropriate components) intact.

Until the power ends, you can ask up to five questions. Depending on what it would know or has witnessed, the target provides visual, audio, or text- based data in response. The target can’t provide new information, and can't speculate about future events.

 Choose a Medium or smaller droid or construct you can see. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. Each time the creature takes damage or is the target of a hostile power while incapacitated in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

  

RELEASE

2nd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of binders, a lock, or another object that contains a mundane or enhanced means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with lock, that power is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

  

REMOVE VIRUS

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

At your touch, all tech-based curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed enhanced item, its curse remains, but the power breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

  

REPAIR DROID

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

A droid or construct you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power only effects droids and constructs.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st. 

  

REPROGRAM DROID

5th-level tech power

nute

You alter the protocols of a droid that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. The droid must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.

While the droid is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 lightning damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but it can only do so once each day.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the power ends. You can end the power early by using an action to dismiss it.

The remove virus power also ends it.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.

When you cast this power using a tech slot of 9th level, the power lasts until it is ended by remove virus.

  

REWRITE MEMORY

5th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to alter a droid or construct's memories. One droid or construct that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another power, this power ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

The target's mind fills in any gaps in the altered memory. If the power ends before you have finished prescribing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the power ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how the target behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the target's core programming, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the target enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a glitch. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a target in a significant manner.

A remove virus or similar power cast on the target restores its true memory.

Overcharge Tech. If you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

  

RIME SHOT

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and the creature gains 1 slowed level

until the end of its turn as the air around it turns frigid.

This power deals additional damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage. This damage increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level.

  

RIME STRIKE

At-will tech power

ion

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn, as the cold energy seeps into its being.

Additionally, if the target doesn't move at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d8 cold damage, and the power ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for not moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

  

RING OF FIRE

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of flames erupts out of the ground in a ring around you with a radius of 15 feet and a height of 10 feet. Creatures who start their turn in the ring of fire or pass through it on their turn take 1d6 fire damage.

Creatures within the ring of fire who willingly try to move through the fire to escape must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to do so. Creatures who are immune to fear or fire automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage of the ring of fire increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

  

SABOTAGE CHARGES

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six tiny sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 2d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Overcharge Tech. The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

  

SALVO

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You launch three projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one sphere is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you create four projectiles. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, you create five projectiles.

  

SCAN AREA

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Program a creature or object that you are familiar with into your tech focus. Using a sonar scan, the tech focus attempts to find a path to the creature's or objects location, as long as that creature or object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature or object is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The power can locate a specific creature or object known to you, or the nearest creature/object of a specific kind (such as a droid or a bothan), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once.

  

SCRAMBLE INTERFACE

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a

bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

  

SCRAMBLING BARRIER

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (10-foot radius)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any tech power of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th. 

  

SCRAMBLING FIELD

8th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power

suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you,

centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its

duration.

Targeted Effects. Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as explosion, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an unenhanced lightsaber.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Tech Override/Diminish Tech. Powers and enhanced effects such as tech override have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other. 

  

SECURITY PROTOCOLS

6th-level tech power

Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Touch

Duration: 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.

When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

When commanded (no action required), security protocols creates the following effects within the secured area.

Corridors. Fog fills all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the lock power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor hologram power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

Electromesh fills all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the electromesh power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while security protocols lasts.

Other power effect. You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the secured area of the stronghold.

Place mobile lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as security protocols lasts.

Place implant message in two locations.

Place debilitating gas in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while security protocols lasts. 

The whole secured area radiates power. A dimish tech cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

  

SENDING

3rd-level tech power

ion

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar that possesses a commlink. The creature hears the message, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planets, but if the target is on a different planet than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

  

SENSOR PROBE

4th-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a small, temporary, invisible probe that hovers in the air for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the probe. It has darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the probe up to 30 feet in any direction. There's no limit on how far away from you it can be. A solid barrier blocks the probe's movement, but it can pass through an opening at least 1 inch in diameter.

  

SHARED SHIELDING

2nd-level tech power

action

This power wards a willing creature you touch and creates an energy link between you and the target until the power ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The power ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the power is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the power as an action. 

  

SHATTER

A creature takes 3d8 sonic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

An unenhanced object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the power's area.

You fire an undulating, warbling bolt of energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6

damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attacks damage type, as shown below.

2 Cold

creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and a small target only visible to you marks it. The next attack roll you make against the

creature before the end of your next turn can't suffer from disadvantage.

This power deals additional damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. This damage increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.

  

TECH OVERRIDE

3rd-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 reaction Range: 60 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a tech power. If the creature is casting a power of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect. If it is casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an

ability check using your techcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the creature's power fails and has no effect.

The blast can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this power, and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.

TRACKER DROID INTERFACE

1st-level tech power

Casting Time: 1 hour Range: 10 feet Duration: Instantaneous

You interface a tracker droid with your tech focus, creating a permanent link.

Your tracker droid acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it acts on your turn.

While your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it via your tech focus.

Additionally, as an action, you can see through your droid's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the droid has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can't maintain an interface between more than one tracker droid and your tech focus at a time.

Finally, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your tracker can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your tracker droid must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You launch a grappling wire toward a creature you

can see within range. Make a melee tech attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## APPENDIX A: CONDITIONS

BLINDED

A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.

Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

  

CHARMED

A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or enhanced effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

  

DEAFENED

A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

  

DISEASED

A diseased creature suffers effects that vary based on the disease.

  

EXHAUSTION

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

Exhaustion Level

1 Disadvantage on ability checks

2 1 slowed level

3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws

4 Hit point maximum halved

5 4 slowed levels

6 Death

  

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current exhaustion level increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current exhaustion level as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has 1 slowed level and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is

reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

  

FRIGHTENED

A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

  

GRAPPLED

A grappled creature has 4 slowed levels. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition). The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect.

  

INCAPACITATED

An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

  

INVISIBLE

An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

  

PARALYZED

A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can't move or speak.

The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

  

PETRIFIED

A petrified creature is transformed, along with any object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

RESTRAINED

A restrained creature has 4 slowed levels.

Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

  

SHOCKED

A shocked creature can't take reactions

On its turn, a shocked creature can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both.

## APPENDIX B: RECOMMENDED VARIANT RULES

  

DEFENSE ROLLS

One of the first variant rules I added to my games was the Defense Rolls, published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules. Essentially, instead of the GM making attack rolls against the players' static AC, the players make defense rolls against the GM's static attack save DC. Implementing this is easy.

  

CALCULATING DEFENSE BONUS (DB)

Armor class is replaced with Defense Bonus. This bonus is calculated simply by players taking their AC and subtracting 10. If a player had an AC of 16, they would have a DB of +6.

  

CALCULATING ATTACK SAVE DC

Attack bonuses you find on monster cards are similar converted to static values, called the attack save DC. To calculate this DC, simply take the listed attack bonus and add 12 to it. For instance, a B1 battle droid's blaster rifle attacks with a +4 modifier. Instead, that droid would have an attack save DC of 16.

  

MAKING THE ROLL

Instead of the GM making attack rolls, players make defense rolls by rolling a d20 and adding their Defense Bonus. If the roll meets or exceeds the attack save DC, the player successfully defends. If a character fails the the defense roll, the attack hits.

If the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.

If the defense roll comes up a 1 on the d20, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally 

score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges. Similarly, a 20 on the defense roll would automatically be a successful dodge, regardless of the attack save DC.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

This is the first variant rule I implemented at my table, and it has thus far been  universally loved. Keeping players engaged is very important at the table. Additionally, abilities that players have that allow them to know your attack rolls are simpler since the player rolls the dice in the open.

While I use this rule, and will continue to do so, when my players encounter "boss"-type mobs, I roll attack rolls as normal. I especially recommend this rule if you utilize the Space Combat optional rule set. Since the pilot on many larger ships doesn't operate the weapons, using this rule keeps them further engaged.

  

SAVING THROW CHECKS

Also published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules was a rule for your players to roll when they use powers or abilities that call for a save DC. Instead of the GM making saving throws against the players' static save DCs, the players roll a saving throw check against the GM's defense save DC.

CALCULATING SAVING THROW CHECK

If players have their save throw DCs calculated, simply subtract 8 from that value. If your consular's force save DC is 15, your saving throw check modifier is +7.

CALCULATING DEFENSE SAVE DC

Monster cards also include potential saving throws, which can easily be converted to a defense save DC. Take the appropriate ability score modifier and add 14 to it. If the monster is proficient in the saving throw (indicated in the saving throw line on the monster card, if it exists), instead use that value. For instance, if a B1 battle droid is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, its defense save DC would be 16 (14+2).

MAKING THE ROLL

Instead of the GM rolling saving throws for the monsters, players make saving throw checks by rolling a d20 and adding their saving throw check modifier. If the roll meets or exceeds the defense save DC, the creature fails the saving throw. If a character fails the saving throw check, the creature successfully saves. If the defender would normally have advantage on the saving roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the saving throw check, and vice versa if the defender would have disadvantage.

  

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

For all the same reasons as defense rolls. Players enjoy it, and it makes it easier for me to GM. Again, I don't use this rule when players encounter bosses.

  

FORCE AND TECH PROWESS

When you fail an ability check, if you added your proficiency bonus to the check and you did not have advantage or disadvantage, you can spend 1 force or tech point to reroll the die. You can only use this feature once per ability check, and you must use the new roll.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

This is actually a holdover from before the casting ability modifier was added to force and tech points.

SIMPLIFIED FORCECASTING

The current version of the SW5e PHB has the player using different ability scores depending on the alignment of the powers they are trying to cast:

Wisdom for light side, Charisma for dark side, player's choice for universal. For new players, this might be too complicated. Consider letting them instead choose between using Wisdom and Charisma as their forcecasting ability.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

This is a wonderful simplification for new players. I, personally, love the alignment determining the

forcecasting ability, and I have relatively experienced players, so I haven't felt a need to use this.

  

ASI AND A FEAT

This one is simple. At level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, when a player gets the opportunity to choose between adding 2 to their ability scores or a feat, I'm letting them add 1 to an ability score and choose a feat.

Now, this is going to create more powerful players, which means you need to pit them against more powerful monsters. I, personally, love this rule because I know it helps experienced players realize the exact character they want and helps to differentiate different characters of the same class. Then again, I'm a huge proponent of feats in general.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

I love feats and I love powerful player characters, so as a GM this rule works well for me. It's not for everyone.

  

CRUELER CRITICALS

Normally, when you score a critical hit, you roll the damage dice twice and add your modifier once. For instance, if you are wielding a weapon that deals 1d8 kinetic damage and is governed by Strength, on a critical hit you deal 2d8 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage. Sometimes, poor rolls lead to you doing less damage on a critical hit than a normal hit. For instance, you might roll two 1's on your 2d8, which with your +3 Strength modifier is only 5 damage. This feels lackluster. With this rule, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, you instead maximize the damage once and then roll the second die. So, using the above example, instead of rolling 2d8 and adding your Strength modifier, you instead roll 1d8, add 8 for the maximum die roll, and then add your Strength modifier. This will make critical hits feel more impactful.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

As indicated above, this variant rule helps make crits more impactful, but it's a double-edged sword, since it can make damage against a player spike, too.

MILESTONE LEVELING

I won't delve too far into this. The simplified version is that instead of receiving experience for every encounter and leveling up at odd times, the GM chooses when they level up. Additionally, there never has the potential to be an experience, and

consequently level disparity between players.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

Milestone leveling eliminates unnecessary record- keeping, helps maintain narrative significance to leveling up, and streamlines the GM controlling the game.

Additionally, if you utilize the Space Combat optional rule set, I urge you to use this. The nature of space combat is that there is no ship leveling up. Experience values relative to the amount required to level up will diminish drastically.

  

BONUS ACTION CONSUMABLES

Most consumables require an action to use, which makes sense when applying them to others. However, a common adjustment in 5e (which is even more logical in SW5e), is to allow administering such consumables to yourself as a bonus action, instead. This only applies to consumables that confer a positive benefit, such as a repair kit or medpac.

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

This is a pretty common house rule at most tables, I believe. I've always used it since I discovered it years ago.

  

HUNTED

In some eras of Star Wars history, forcecasters are a rarity, and are hunted across the galaxy by the likes of Inquisitors, or if they're unlucky, a Dark Lord of the Sith, in an attempt to crush any foreseen threats to their rule. Should you want your forcecasting players to experience this additional level of drama and suspense, here is an alternate rule to implement: Whenever a player casts a force power, others in the Galaxy may detect their presence through ripples in the Force. Each player has a pool of Disturbance Points. This pool of Disturbance Points increases every time a force power is cast by a number of points equal to the level of the force power used (at-will powers are treated as Level 0). After each combat, roll a percentile dice for each player that used a force power. If you roll a number equal to or lower than the players Disturbance Pool, they are detected by Jedi Hunters of your determination, who begin to hunt the player they detected. During each long rest, decrease each players pool of Disturbance Points by an amount equal to their level. 

WHY I RECOMMEND THIS RULE

I actually run a campaign in the Old Republic era, so I don't use this rule. It is great, however, for those who run in more restricted eras.
