CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP STARSHIPS

This chapter is designed to help you integrate this into your campaign, from the perspective of a player. It helps you to build Han Solo as a Pilot, with his ship the Millennium Falcon.

CHAPTER 2: DEPLOYMENTS

Deployments are the certain locations that might exist on a ship, and what actions are granted by manning a deployment. There are five potential deployments:

coordinator, gunner, mechanic, operator and pilot. Any character can engage in any deployment, though some characters are more suited to certain deployments.

Additionally, once a player has chosen a favored deployment, they will be able to specialize in that deployment. Specializing in a deployment unlocks features specific to that deployment via a series of ranks (levels).

CHAPTER 3: STARSHIPS

This chapter covers the acquisition of a starship, as well as upgrading starships to higher tiers (levels). Unlike classes, starship tiers are locked to the size category of the starship. Within each starship tier,

however, there are choices that let you specialize your ship in a direction of your choice.

CHAPTER 4: MODIFICATIONS

As your starship progresses in tiers, it unlocks upgrade slots, which can be spent on upgrades. Upgrades fall into one of five categories: engineering, operation, suite, universal, and weapon.

  CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT

Equipment functions in a similar capacity to the ground component, with the except of it needing to be integrated into a ship as opposed to just held. There are five major equipment types: armor, shields,

weapons, hyperdrives, and navcomputers.

CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

Characters can choose to focus on a single deployment, or multiple deployments via

multispeccing. Additionally, as characters unlock ranks in deployments they gain access to ventures (feats).

CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES

While deployed in a starship, rather than using their own physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), skills will instead use the respective ability score of the ship. As ship's have no mental

ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma), the players will still use their own.

CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING

This chapter discusses the adventuring component of space. One new feature, turning speed, has been

added. The oversimplification is that, unlike players, ships can't easily change directions. In addition to flying speed, ships have a turning speed; in order to turn 90 degrees, the ship must spend that many feet of movement.

CHAPTER 9: COMBAT

Combat is designed to function similar to combat on the ground; players still roll their own initiative and act on their own turn. The key difference is the actions available to players are keyed to their specific

deployment. For instance, the pilot controls the movement of the ship, and the gunner controls the weapons.

CHAPTER 10: GENERATING ENCOUNTERS

This chapter is designed to help GMs build interesting encounters.

                                                                        CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP STARSHIPS  

our first step in transitioning to the space portion of your Star Wars 5th Edition campaign is![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ymo35YsXKaypNQ6PG_-cfZa1QEDsrqFglzaGVdDl6P3Y6ctikX5KJS0UPUlCbc2GmZLHPo19tXUnucYFXzqmOn0ZLbA5e29-FsmhvAZCWZxRyLC_GZFrQ0G0D5TWyXBFrI5paU4ymaLeRbl6AwhQ6w)

imagining how having a starship impacts your

character. When participating in the space portion of the game, your character is impacted by a number of features, including their chosen deployment, the size and style of ship on which they adventure, and the modification and equipment that ship has access to. These choices can enhance and enrich your avatar.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about where your adventurer would be most likely to participate in a starship. You might be a dauntless pilot, or a crushing gunner. Perhaps you are a genius mechanic, an

intricate operator, or a charming pilot. Maybe you are interested in a mixture of these roles.

Additionally, what kind of ship, and your intended purpose, can impact these decisions. Do you want to be a soldier in the Imperial Navy, piloting a TIE fighter and leading a squadron? Or are you more inclined to travel as a mercenary aboard a light freighter, taking

jobs as you see fit in order to keep your ship in space? Maybe you instead want to be a bounty hunter in an assault craft, tracking your quarry to the Outer Rim, and beyond?

Once you have an idea in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character and ship you want. Your conception of your character and starship might evolve with each choice you make.

What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.

Throughout this section, we use the term deployment sheet and starship sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it's a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook

paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how

1. ACQUIRE A STARSHIP
    

A crew is nothing without its starship, and this chapter covers the acquisition and initial set up of starships.

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7Y3MYqGGqiXBassciCvtHGKItYxXRh-SURXUN66CReZAjszmZku361Q0vOgd_pCnAv0Lmz7beX7F1QkiTpxkSgb9y1SC4eOG1xyWjZr66A7ctxNqsJdnl4Ve3WIgSHKMLp1CaD9LxFB5Npl74uXWCQ)

Like classes and deployments, starships have their own features that are driven by their size category. The Starships chapter provides more information about

acquiring a starship, starship size categories, and starship features.

What starship you acquire is the second impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each size category of starship has unique and tangible features, and determines what kind of crew your starship can support. A Small starship, for instance, can support 1-2 crew members

at tier 0, while a Medium starship can support an entire adventuring party. At larger sizes, the crew shifts into the hundreds and thousands of crew members a ship

can support.

## TIER

Once you've obtained your starship—through any number of ways—you gain the ability to upgrade your ship. Typically, like deployments, starships are obtained at tier 0. A tier 0 ship is typically newly constructed, or otherwise not yet battle-tested or broken in.

Starting off at tier 0 marks the beginning of your starship's journey and evolution. Over time, with the use of resources and workers—and credits—a starship can be upgraded from tier 0 all the way up to tier 5, unlocking unique features—and choices—as it improves.

## HULL POINTS AND HULL DICE

Your starship's hull points define how tough your

ship's hull is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hull points are determined by your Hull Dice (short for Hull Point Dice).

At tier 0, your starship has a varying quantity and size of Hull Dice, depending on its size category. Your starship starts with hull points equal to the highest roll of that die, as well as the average roll for each

additional Hull Die. You also add your Constitution modifier to each die. This is your hull point maximum.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zNEfOTf_L0PtTIYfdpG60hycabPYZ4LUdXR3p86ae4dcf5edotYA3NT_sEpjhaU_VICBFZyKzTr_c-uums3ZTWWWu2JFo2t5hELA4_wA9S_uwg0sJ5XkQCSy51Engwu1Cp0WTZTYaNnp3CBou2iohg)

Record your starship's hull points on your starship sheet. Also record the type of Hull Die your starship uses and the number of Hull Dice it has. After you

conduct repairs—and at certain other points—you can spend Hull Dice to regain hull points (see "Repairs" in the Adventuring section).  

## SHIELD POINTS AND SHIELD DICE

Most starships also have shields, although they do not come standard, and their strength—your ship's shield point maximum—and the amount they can regenerate each round—your ship's shield regeneration rate—is determined partially by your Shield Dice and partially by your choice of shields,

detailed in the Equipment chapter. The number and type of shield dice normally parallels your Hull Dice.

  
  

## Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 1

The Millennium Falcon is a heavily modified YT-1300f light freighter, and falls under the Medium size

category. The ship starts at tier 0.

As a tier 0 Medium ship, the Millennium Falcon has 5 Hull Dice—which are d8s—and a Constitution

modifier of +1. Consequently, the Millennium Falcon has 33 hull points: 8 + the average for the subsequent four dice (5) + the Constitution modifier for each Hull Die (5 x 1).

When the Millennium Falcon progresses to tier 1 it gains the following features: Starship Improvements and Evasive Maneuvers. We record Evasive Maneuvers on the starship sheet. Since the Millennium Falcon is fast, we increase its Strength with the Ability Score Improvement. It gains an additional Hull Dice, and it's current and maximum hull points increases by 6. It also gains additional modifications, discussed in

Chapter 4.

Additionally, at tier 0, a Medium ship gets a choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws

proficiencies. For the Falcon, we choose Strength.

  
  

2. DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES
    

Much of what your ship does in the game depends on its six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores chapter. The

Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability. Ships size categories decrease and/or increase the base

ability scores, as can tier advancements and ship modifications.

You generate your ship’s six ability scores using a standard array of ability scores that you assign to each ability as you wish (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma): 15, 14, 13, 12, 10,

8. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your ship size.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without

consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

  

## Building The Millennium Falcon, Step 2

We will use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for the Falcon’s abilities. The Falcon is fast nimble, so we’ll put it's highest scores, 15 and 14, in Strength and Dexterity, respectively. We then apply the 13 to Intelligence, the 12 to Constitution, the 10 to Wisdom and the 8 to Charisma. Because Medium ships have no ability score adjustments, The Falcon's ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 15

(+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence

13 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 8 (-1).

  

## VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES

At your Game Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ship's ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a ship with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7

points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are

above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.

CHAPTER 1 | STEP-BY-STEP STARSHIPS 10  

3. INSTALLING MODIFICATIONS
    

Your starship includes a number of standard modifi- cations, and can include more modifications—at the

expense of credits, workers, and time—enhancing and augmenting the ship's functionality. Modifications fall into five categories: engineering, operation, suite, universal, and weapon. The Modifications chapter

provides more information about these categories and installation costs.

  
  

## Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 3

At tier 0, the Millennium Falcon comes with one Barracks at no cost. Additionally, we choose a Living Quarters to give the crew their own rooms. We also choose the Recreation and Storage Compartment suites, bringing the total modifications to 3.

The Millennium Falcon has dorsal and ventral

cannons, so we choose two Fixed Hardpoints. Addi- tionally, these are turrets that can fire in a 360 degree arc, so we add two turreted hardpoints, both with di- rect control mods. We're up to 9 modifications.

She has a Hyperdrive and Navcomputer, bringing the total modifications to 11.

Finally, the Falcon has exterior protection, so we take the Anti-Boarding System as our 12th mod.

As Han gains credits, he continues to upgrade the ship, eventually installing an Improved Navcomputer modification, two weapon slave arrays to allow firing the turrets from the cockpit, and another fixed

hardpoint.

  
  

4. CHOOSE EQUIPMENT
    

Starships have access to certain types of equipment. Every starship has access to armor and shields as well as a reactor and a power coupling system, and most have access to weapons. Many starships, especially larger ones, have access to hyperdrives and

navcomputers. The Equipment chapter provides more information on these categories.

## ARMOR CLASS

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your starship avoids being damaged in battle—either my avoiding being hit entirely or by remaining essentially unharmed from an attack. Your AC is determined by three major factors: your base AC, your starship's Dexterity modifier, and the type of armor your ship has installed.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DP3wN4q_QemxoxqwN8dqqvl2UW9KRddwTPZdprB1mD4JYUw3IC85jE7OqQFlQqN0hJh4WXeIcxY2776PNeoTw-MGZuTCXei7FzrdggGcJCYS_bKfzbGWa_AsTNOZ8AeVvNWMzV7gvkLTQ_VXIdUl1Q)

Your ship has a base AC of 10 (without any plating modifications). You then add (or subtract) the two other factors above: Dexterity modifier, and a bonus or penalty to your ship's AC based on armor chosen in the

chapter.

## WEAPONS

Your ship can have a number of weapons no greater than the number of fixed hardpoints it has. For each fixed hardpoint, a single weapon can be attached.

When making attack rolls, or setting the save DC for ship weapons, we use the starship's Intelligence modifier, and the ship's proficiently equipped bonus. We also add the ship's Strength modifier to damage rolls.

  

11 CHAPTER 1 | STEP-BY-STEP STARSHIPS

  

## Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 4

The Millennium Falcon has a base AC of 10. With a Dexterity of 14, we add 2 to the Millennium Falcon's base armor class. Additionally, the Falcon comes with deflection armor installed, which we will change out for lightweight armor, further increasing the AC to 14.

The Falcon has two turreted hardpoints, and we choose traditional quad laser cannons to equip to

them. When making an attack roll with either weapon, we use the ship's Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship's proficiently equipped bonus (+3). When making a damage roll, we add the ship's Strength modifier (+2). The fixed hardpoint is equipped with a missile launcher and is loaded with concussion missiles. The missile's saving throw has a DC equal to 8 plus the ship's Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship's

proficiently equipped bonus (+3). We note that the quad laser cannons have an unlimited firing arc, do

2d4 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 800/3200, can fire in rapid mode, and overheat after shooting 8 shots. The concussion missiles have a limited firing

arc, do 2d8 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 600/2400 and must fire in either burst 1 or rapid

mode. These Falcon can fire 8 missiles before needing to be reloaded, and these missiles have the

"explosive" feature, which will force concentration checks by characters on affected ships.

  

5. COME TOGETHER
    

Most Star Wars characters don't work alone, and while some starships can be operated by a single crew member, it is more dynamic—and engaging—to crew a starship with a party—each member of the party fulfilling a needed role on the ship. Teamwork and

cooperation greatly improve your party's chance to survive the unapologetic lethality of spacefaring.

## DEPLOYMENTS

There are six major roles directly tied to the control of a starship: coordinator, gunner, mechanic, operator, pilot, and technician. Any character can have any one or more roles on the ship at any given time, but

because there are only some functions a pilot can access, one character must be deployed as the pilot.

How your character interacts with your ship—or enemy ships—is determined by what they decide to do on any particular turn, but characters will usually begin to focus on one or two particular roles. The Deployments chapter provides more information![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IOjHi3NVD5yODKBfMZChpf57tAWjfc41yN2IK-sAI6MHplDFgXMkb8e53K_lOV8PyJ1jTBWIb53Ym3uuHRptJe3OPY3hOsHShiDGMW8gQ5NAJ1C_Ui0mOkhw6PJWHEG8X4Kw0BzFqqTIGvgfv2SV9g)

about each deployment.

The deployment you choose may be the first impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each of the six

deployments has a unique and tangible function, and many of them interact—and synergize—with your

character's species and class features. As you progress through the ranks of your chosen deployment, you unlock unique features that augment and enhance your interaction with that deployment, potentially granting you new actions, or simply improving the

actions already available to your deployment.  

  
  

## RANK

Typically, a character starts their space journey at

deployment rank 0, and advances through the ranks (up to 5th) over time. A rank 0 character is typically inexperienced in the ways of their starship, although he or she might have been on a starship previously.

Starting off at rank 0 marks your character's entry in the spacefarer life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing SW5e campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher rank, on assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures. Record your rank on your deployment sheet. If you're starting at a higher rank, record the additional elements your

## BEYOND 5TH RANK

Characters who reach 5th rank across their

deployments may want to continue progressing in their starship skills. Additional prestige earned can yield additional ranks, though no character can gain higher than 5th rank in any deployment. For each rank beyond 5th, the amount of required prestige increases by 50; achieving 6th rank would require an additional 100 prestige (200 total), while achieving 7th rank would  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

As your characters—and their starship—go on adventures and overcome challenges, they can

increase in their ranks and tiers, respectively. While tiers are driven by the amount of effort—and credits— directly applied to the starship, ranks are earned

separately.

Typically, characters start at deployment rank 0,

achieving rank 1 after completing their first successful encounter and earning prestige. The GM may decide, however, that characters start at 1st rank or higher,

depending on choices in a character's background or during an adventure. Higher ranks are achieved by successfully completing more encounters and earning more prestige, as shown below in the Deployment Rank Prestige table.

## Deployment Rank Prestige

  

When your starship gains a tier, it unlocks additional features, depending on its size, as detailed in the

description. Some of these features allow you to increase your starship's ability scores. You can't

increase an ability score above 20 unless otherwise noted.

Each time your starship gains a tier, it gains gain 1 additional Hull Die and 1 additional Shield Die. Roll the Hull Die, add your ship's Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hull point maximum.

Next, roll the Shield Die, add your ship's Stength modifier to the roll, and add the total to your base shield points which is then multiplied by the

appropriate factor depending on which shields your ship has. Alternatively, for both hull and shields, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,

which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up). When your ship's Constitution modifier increases by

1, its hull point maximum increases by 1 for each Hull Die it has. For example, if your tier 0 Medium ship has a Constitution score of 14, when it reaches tier 1, you increases its Constitution score from 14 to 16, thus increasing its Constitution modifier from +2 to +3. At tier 0, your Medium starship has a total of 6 Hull Dice, so its hull point maximum then increases by 6. The same rules apply to your base shield points and your Strength score.  

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1st|1|
|2nd|4|
|3rd|8|
|4th|12|
|5th|16|

  

Anything that requires the characters to exercise their skills yields prestige. Defeating, routing, or escaping an encounter are the most common

methods, but other actions might yield prestige at the discretion of the GM; completing a training simulation or successfully talking your way out of a situation might earn you prestige, for instance.

  
  
  

CHAPTER 2: DEPLOYMENTS

dventurers are extraordinary people, driven![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b-5YDO02yUwB2sm7BmD01O25tFvOGbBBjX6mSBsa9enuq8Sdr92SXKIKuR49_FpXXUv31_xtYyB_UTNoN9CZgI81tDi6z7hHcwaR5PYD5R1odOqzqdcfW7UM_Z740-c0ju4ViuFKy3cTjS4LOuoTvg)  

by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.

Deployments are roles your characters can fill that are not directly correlated with their class. A character can then specialize in a specific deployment, granting a variety of features, such as the gunner's gambits or the pilot's tactics. As you progress in your deployment specialization, you gain more powerful features, and some features improve. Each deployment specialization entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every rank, and a detailed explanation of each one.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Q5ZABGmPreC7EOgx8a4dVcA-_btcYpEZyc0f7SHzHulLQjfX0vwvK0rj4BKd0orQvBsOLI0kIXx4eLspU9KMxiyCX4cheoIt02Z29QatsBdOyw_3TUwptmRGfTPZ8LRGsXRUYVJTBQ__lN_EeVzYsg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pp9YXIxaqYtUZ5OhufdyEB7DfJbfydFPfi6kZLHLf-c4THlCW23z0gERRlXIiiEQBUh--Q6Ma9HnecNVAE1l8_g7zYyaZbAYAElKxAPepe7B8O4VLCk6nO_PAeIyP8iqLdP7fun-MGirQFn4Tc88lg)

Each ship has a number of deployments determined by its size and class. A TIE Fighter, for instance, only has a singe deployment, who controls all of the aspects of his fighter and is in charge of all roles. The Millennium

Falcon, however, has space for a pilot, two gunners, a mechanic, a technician, a coordinator, and an operator. Each deployment has specific tasks and abilities related

positioning of his outnumbered fleet. With a quick barking of orders, he directs his officers to relay that his fleet should prepare to converge on the opposing capital ship, with the knowledge that if they can disrupt the enemy's plans, their mission is complete.

The Sith Lord maneuvers his interceptor into formation with his apprentices. Communicating through encrypted channels, he directs them to move outward to flank their quarry. As they converge from the sides, the Sith launches a debilitating volley, disrupting his prey's systems and readying the ship for capture.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. As the twi'lek pilot begins evasive maneuvers, the human coordinator immediately jumps to action. He directs his crew towards their stations, while reaching out with the Force. As each of his respective crew members settles into their respective roles, he directs their actions to coincide, leading his team to victory.

Without coordination, many a ship would fall to disorganization and a chaos. It is the job of the coordinator to facilitate communication and teamwork, and to keep his ship, or fleet, productive.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/f2kIs7JVzfgHCZtpcbwwjEncSk11LqZLxrbXXfVPf26f7DNx6SGM6eGWvPdRaGnJHQynKVZ3X8kY43Rk077cIcR6cJscVmeYrFLGvySW4M20w4ooAew6pyVagFSg02AH9BF27QthUd3ss2TK_kP-qA)

VENTURE

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

COORDINATING LEADERSHIP

Also at 1st rank, you learn collaborations that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

## COLLABORATIONS

You learn two collaborations of your choice, which are detailed under "Collaborations" below. You can use only one collaboration per turn, and you can only use each collaboration once per round.

You learn an additional collaboration at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new collaboration, you can also replace one collaboration you know with a different one.

## POWER DICE

A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the collaboration.

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

COLLABORATIONS

The collaborations are presented in alphabetical order.

### Comms

## WATCH OUT

### Comms  

On your turn, you can use your action and expend one power die to bolster the resolve of the crew of your or another allied ship. That ship gains temporary hit points equal to the power die roll + your Charisma modifier.

## CALL FOR BACKUP![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/47-J4G4OTNaaedki81KL__jM-tSSGpPYNGfoR63meMHgjwsK8kLuLpfRK9ZG1YlWtSNlM38Xmk-cjJBOkRcZP9DT62AxAP5kovTWy-VgnWOdm9WsWg-Z3Gu4SuxndazwfQzp3ABlzPxlaxZho1_Gqg)

### Comms

When a ship makes an attack roll against your ship, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and command another willing ally ship within 300 feet of the enemy ship to intercede. A crew member on that allied ship manning a weapon station must use their reaction to do so. The enemy ship is then forced to make an attack on the ally ship instead. If the attack misses, the crew member can immediately make a weapon attack against the enemy ship as a part of that same reaction. Roll the power die, and add the result to the ally's attack roll.

## HEAD'S UP![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/47-J4G4OTNaaedki81KL__jM-tSSGpPYNGfoR63meMHgjwsK8kLuLpfRK9ZG1YlWtSNlM38Xmk-cjJBOkRcZP9DT62AxAP5kovTWy-VgnWOdm9WsWg-Z3Gu4SuxndazwfQzp3ABlzPxlaxZho1_Gqg)

### Comms

When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a power die and add the number rolled to the initiative of any friendly ship including your own.

## INCITE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/47-J4G4OTNaaedki81KL__jM-tSSGpPYNGfoR63meMHgjwsK8kLuLpfRK9ZG1YlWtSNlM38Xmk-cjJBOkRcZP9DT62AxAP5kovTWy-VgnWOdm9WsWg-Z3Gu4SuxndazwfQzp3ABlzPxlaxZho1_Gqg)

### Comms

On your turn, you can use an action and expend one Power die to bolster the resolve of a crew on your or another allied ship who can see or hear you. The allied ship can add your ship's Charisma modifier to a number of damage rolls they make until the start of your next turn equal to the number rolled on the die.

## OVERWHELMING PRESENCE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/47-J4G4OTNaaedki81KL__jM-tSSGpPYNGfoR63meMHgjwsK8kLuLpfRK9ZG1YlWtSNlM38Xmk-cjJBOkRcZP9DT62AxAP5kovTWy-VgnWOdm9WsWg-Z3Gu4SuxndazwfQzp3ABlzPxlaxZho1_Gqg)

### Comms

As an action, you can make a Charisma (Impress) or Charisma (Menace) skill check and expend one power die to attempt to charm or frighten a humanoid creature who can see and perceive your ship within 600 feet. Add the power die to the roll. The target makes a contested Intelligence (Probe) check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you if you used Impress, or frightened of you if you used Menace, until the end of your next turn.

## STEADY AS SHE GOES![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/47-J4G4OTNaaedki81KL__jM-tSSGpPYNGfoR63meMHgjwsK8kLuLpfRK9ZG1YlWtSNlM38Xmk-cjJBOkRcZP9DT62AxAP5kovTWy-VgnWOdm9WsWg-Z3Gu4SuxndazwfQzp3ABlzPxlaxZho1_Gqg)

### Comms

As an action, you can expend one power die to strengthen your allies' defenses. Roll a power die. Until the end of your next turn, your ship and all allied ships within 500 feet of you when you use this action have a bonus to any saving throws they make equal to the amount rolled.

When a friendly ship, including your own, who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a power die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this collaboration before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.

UPLIFTING DIRECTIVE

At 2nd rank, when you take the Direct action, roll a d20. Note the number on the d20. This becomes your uplifting directive number.

While you have an uplifting directive number, when an ally makes an ability check or attack roll affected by your Direct action, you can replace the result of a d20 roll with the value of the uplifting directive roll. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You can only have one uplifting directive roll at a time, and you lose any unused uplifting directive rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

INSPIRING DISPLAY

Also at 2nd rank, you can inspire others through stirring words. You spend the next minute rallying your allies by giving an inspiring speech. You grant a number of ships up to your proficiency bonus temporary hull points equal to your Charisma modifier. You also grant to a number of crew members up to your proficiency bonus from those ships one Inspiring Display die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Inspiring Display die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiring Display die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiring Display die at a time.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Your Inspiring Display die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

RALLYING CRY

At 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can extend a rallying cry to those that can hear you. Choose a number of friendly creatures up to twice your Charisma modifier that can see or hear you. Each of those creatures gains an Inspiring Display die that lasts until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Also at 3rd rank, when you roll your uplifting directive number as a part of the Direct action, you can use your bonus action to increase your uplifting directive number by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If this would increase the value of your uplifting directive number to more than 20, it instead becomes 20.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/T8G8byGYovs3SsVeYWZiJ1GaLRbKlSR_gcGRICK7mMNJt5NCZdEBV6asEkYjy6z4ij76F_o73UTS3gOAkuCR6vy3bI8LT_XQbcMfICW86VRTlISRKQPgMZynIOSHHsaNGZo-hPbeqJiAuoRW29g4bA)

COMMANDING PRESENCE

At 4th rank, you learn a new way to use your Inspiring Display. While aboard your ship, when a creature that can see or hear you fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use use your reaction to aid that creature provided it did not already have or use an Inspiring Display die this turn. The creature can then roll the die and add it to the result.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

CONTINGENCY PLAN

Also at 4th rank, while aboard your ship, you can choose two allies, instead of one, when you take the Direct action.

PARAGON COORDINATOR

As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or an Inspiring Display die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

LEADER EXTRAORDINAIRE

You regain all expended uses of your Inspiring Display, Rallying Cry, and Commanding Presence features when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you roll an Uplifting Directive number, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Finally, when a creature uses an Inspiring Display die, they take the maximum instead of rolling. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 2 | DEPLOYMENTS 16  

GUNNER

The trandoshan bounty hunter hides in his assault craft

behind a nearby asteroid, patiently awaiting his prey. As it passes along its predetermined course, the trandoshan detonates the seismic charges, disintegrating the ship.

As the gunship moves away from its parent vessel, the zabrak soldier begins scoping out the opposing fleet. As the two forces engage, the gunner chooses his target, engaging his railgun. After its 3-second charge time, a massive blast of energy projects towards his target, vaporizing it instantly.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human runs to her gunning station, hops into the chair, and engages the controls. As her twi'lek pilot maneuvers the ship out of danger, the gunner draws a bead on the offending snubfighter, before unleashing a quick 1-2 volley and detonating them in a fiery blaze.

Whether coming from a military, criminal, or civilian background, all gunners share the same love of precise and effective destruction of their targets.

VENTURE

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

GUNNER TECHNIQUES

Also at 1st rank, you learn gambits that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

## GAMBITS![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hiJyS82l8SJfXTO_YygKnC-bIW8ym3f9I69__HueA7RgKrCPCQeeuOAhXi8DCsTctyXjmUaGcuUneNhl31bC-Xj5c5FAFVjSy-8pNW4buaxyTfFl8xuASpwCr-QuiqKd4NHlYAtERfuxSk5_9X0Qng)

You learn two gambits of your choice, which are detailed under "Gambits" below. Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each gambit once per turn.

You learn an additional gambit at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new gambit, you can also replace one gambit you know with a different one.

## POWER DICE

A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the gambit.

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

### Weapons

GUNNING STYLE

At 2nd rank, you adopt a particular style of gunning as your specialty. Choose one of the Gunning Style  

When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you

can expend one power die to add it to the roll. On a hit, the ship has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.

## DISTRACTING SHOT![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Zy04Gpm9bEY3CGayylW2NsRp0hAnHEx5ug_ypU8T2TUW_UMr68d5R6F7cDGV2B0nUDilPJ-w0IRMrST55L3QSeo1mqkcDDpc3f5jETUz2XTHAUBw2LkL5yCKtPSrqyrpZ-NdGhK96daCV1prIJHupQ)

### Weapons

When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to give your allies an opening. You add the power die to the attack's damage roll, and the next attack roll against the target by someone other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

## EXPLOSIVE SHOT![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Zy04Gpm9bEY3CGayylW2NsRp0hAnHEx5ug_ypU8T2TUW_UMr68d5R6F7cDGV2B0nUDilPJ-w0IRMrST55L3QSeo1mqkcDDpc3f5jETUz2XTHAUBw2LkL5yCKtPSrqyrpZ-NdGhK96daCV1prIJHupQ)

### Weapons

When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack's damage roll. You can use this power before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

IMPROVED CRITICAL

Also at 2nd rank, your critical hit range with primary and secondary weapons increases by 1, and when a ship rolls a 1 on a saving throw against a tertiary or quaternary weapon that you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.

DEPENDABLE GUNNER

Starting at 3rd rank, when you roll for damage with a ship weapon, you can reroll one of the dice, but you must use the new result. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in gunner. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

BRUTAL CRITICAL

Also at 3rd rank, you can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship weapon.

GUNNING MASTERY

At 4th rank, you master a particular style of gunning. Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

PROTEAN GUNNER

Also at 4th rank, you can choose a second Gunning Style option.

PARAGON GUNNER

At 5th rank, when you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, when you make an attack roll while deployed as a gunner, you can choose to make the roll a critical hit. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

MECHANIC

Flinching occasionally as a cannon blast slams into the ship, a

Chiss engineer quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on their small vessel. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs over to bypass the fried motivator.

Sweat dripping down her brow, the Togrutan mechanic concentrates as she types furiously, trying a new inverter subroutine to eek out just a bit more power from her ship's main reactor. As the whine from the fusion plant increases just a hair, she bites her lip and looks to the pressure gauge. It's holding. She gets on the comm and shout's to her captain, "Punch it!" The ship lurches forward, the engines drawing heavily on the new reserves of power. They were going to make it.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. In the cockpit, the sounds of a muned explosion can be heard. With a shrill chirp, the droid engine tech whirls into action, rolling towards the source of the explosion. As it enters the engine room, it identifies the source of the explosion, and quickly moves to repair the damage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zboph-OwKSWMKn20J1S2EjhInVlBEvGYSOzModhSNKppJ36vYdXkj9AxazAzA0Xy20V6Dx5zPlD-fS34RDersf46H5GLCa6HxGZNCu2E764SvQmsSW9V56ZhxsCgBA2Apga7lymaHzeXOxBmHsbaUw)

While mechanics come from all walks of life, they all share one thing in common; they gather an immense satisfaction from keeping their ship running at peak efficiency.

VENTURE

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

SYSTEM BOOST

Also at 1st rank, you learn techniques to quickly augment different systems on your ship that are fueled by special dice called tech dice.

## TECHNIQUES

You learn two techniques of your choice, which are detailed under "Techniques" below. You can use only one technique per turn, and you can only use each technique once per round.

You learn an additional technique at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new technique, you can also replace one technique you know with a different one.

## TECH DICE

Your techniques are represented by your tech die, the starting size of which is a d4. Using your tech die does not expend it.

Your tech die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

## CREATIVE THINKING

If you roll a 1 on your tech die, it decreases by one die size until the end of your next turn. This represents you burning through your creativity. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 1, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 1, it becomes unusable until the end of your next turn.

Conversely, if you roll the maximum number on your tech die, it increases by one die size until the end of your next turn, up to a d12. This represents you having a creative break-through. For example, if you roll a 4 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. If it's a d12 and you roll a 12, on future rolls until the end of your next turn, you can roll an extra die and choose which die to use.

TECHNIQUES

The techniques are presented in alphabetical order.

## COMMS BOOST

As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Charisma (Interfere) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

## ENGINE TUNING

As an action, you can roll your tech die. Take the result of the die and multiply it by 50. The flying speed of your ship increases by this amount until the end of your next turn.

## POWER DISTRIBUTION

As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die and move that number of power dice from their current location to another location.

## QUIET ELECTRONICS

As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Dexterity (Stealth) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

## REACTOR BOOST

As an action, you can roll your tech die. Your reactor immediately produces that many power dice that must be stored immediately based on your ship's power coupling. For any power dice produced in excess of your ship's capacity to store, your ship takes that many hull points in damage.

Additionally, your ship must succeed on a Constitution (Regulation) check (DC = 10 + the number rolled on your tech die) or take hull damage equal to one hull die + your ship's strength modifier.

## SENSOR BOOST

As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

## SHIELD REINFORCEMENT

As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die. Your shields immediately regenerate by the result of the die.

## WEAPON OVERLOAD

As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die. The next time a ship weapon deals damage before the end of your next turn, it deals additional damage equal to the result of the die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

QUICK FIXER

At 2nd rank, when you take the Patch action or conduct ship repairs during recharging, you have advantage on the Constitution (Patch) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

SHIP MECHANIC

Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one.

DEPENDABLE TECH

Starting at 3rd rank, you can regain use of your starting tech die as a reaction. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

REROUTE POWER

Also at 3rd rank, as an action on each of your turns, you can reroute power between your ship's engines, shields, and weapons through use of the ship's power coupling. A power coupling can be toggled to neutral, where all three aspects function normally, or can divert power to a specific system.

When diverting power to a system, the effects of that system are doubled:

Engines: A ship's flying speed is doubled. Shields: Shields take half damage and shield regeneration rate is doubled.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KmLDaZcm1xJ9-v2zSxw9EptdttvzQHxXxsKtUDLzy86K459qsc2aI-K6psBjVCnz-1Vi7BS8i5XZLdIdgikSkJtLxoaA5wR83yNwlbxDsEb-ucpBC1W516DYVyTcNf2U_guFtOTcZKnC_hX88iH80Q)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iRNjvUaYorqQnPMGQGCBY4AzegMKPG4uqpCSNEEGOjgy3IHxdBHz4ktbP43MA5alpELfh5SeoIO6IGvb5jL_FTeEK6m_TV40OMo8X7SQ_uT9NlkrjdLjrJnIyTQQsUf71XT1DqzcyNhqySzckIaVAw)

Weapons deal double damage.

When diverting power to a system, power to the other systems is halved:

Engines: A ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Shields: Shields take double damage and shield regeneration rate reduced by half.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KmLDaZcm1xJ9-v2zSxw9EptdttvzQHxXxsKtUDLzy86K459qsc2aI-K6psBjVCnz-1Vi7BS8i5XZLdIdgikSkJtLxoaA5wR83yNwlbxDsEb-ucpBC1W516DYVyTcNf2U_guFtOTcZKnC_hX88iH80Q)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iRNjvUaYorqQnPMGQGCBY4AzegMKPG4uqpCSNEEGOjgy3IHxdBHz4ktbP43MA5alpELfh5SeoIO6IGvb5jL_FTeEK6m_TV40OMo8X7SQ_uT9NlkrjdLjrJnIyTQQsUf71XT1DqzcyNhqySzckIaVAw)

Ship weapon damage is reduced by half.

RAPID REPAIRMAN

At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiently equipped bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hull Dice, instead of one. For each Hull Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship's Constitution modifier to it.

EFFICIENT REROUTE

Also at 4th rank, when you reroute power you only halve power to one other system of your choice.

PARAGON TECH

As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you make a Strength (Boost) check or a Constitution (Regulate) check, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

SUPREME BOOST

As of 5th rank, you learn to briefly and massively boost your ship's system. When you use a technique that uses a bonus action, you can use another, different technique that also uses a bonus action this turn.

Additionally, instead of rolling your Tech die for these uses, you can choose to take the maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

OPERATOR

"WATCHER'S CONFIDENCE, PLEASE PROCEED TO DOCKING BAY NINETY-

four," comes over the freighter's speakers for a third time. Frantically, the chiss operator types as fast as he can, attempting to disguise his ship's transponder code and true designation. Finally, with a satisfied sigh and a single keystroke, he completes the new temporary identity to his ship.

Methodically, the voss operator types away on the datapad in front of her, one eye on the console and the other on her quarry. As she sees the ship's trajectory abruptly change, she completes her commands, overloading their systems. The ship immediately slows, it's turning become sluggish, enabling the voss to overtake it.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human operator immediately jumps into the co-pilot's seat and interfaces with the control panel. He engages a comm scrambler, disrupting the communications of the enemy ships, in an effort to diminish their coordination.

Operators share their love of a challenge; to overcome the obstacle that few others can comprehend. While they aren't always celebrated, operators are an integral part of any ship's crew.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZSQqYnqzIWBp0p_Rtj89vrI09mLEEHoQst19mcahksh8EKMt4PSIiZU4cLKTYAzF6g2-9aLZ1Y-ipsWfzhRNIcmXZZxiBS1t-ES2yFfUYnx8a0ZGlUzGQ6qLEp8AXI4kpK_n1zTGQpjhv1RBop-anw)

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zY9vt5rcxjYHIS73UsuUpXp2nzktG_z33CGgNZWAu6QLNHRoT5iqRM9Kx3zuqQpyii8dzanV_o3471kniVywlg9vWvzU5U2bPND55dqiMh0HFNE9_7jt7APadM-tE5ObQSebIddpGHUA5VFjJI5-pA)

OPERATIONAL CONTROL

Also at 1st rank, you learn disruptions that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

## DISRUPTIONS

You learn two disruptions of your choice, which are detailed under "Disruptions" below. You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.

You learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.

## POWER DICE

A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

## SAVING THROWS

Some of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Disruption save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship's Charisma modifier![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SURrcxErnERDzCe-6vFrnCg8jDi6G4KDIvWI_LkmTMaiEBD2FlYTq94hr8aTx4gqaWCLRZUoy_Q7na2WjyGYNIooWFuolACAD-8sUsp4YYkJmoCLZEdQOQcxaaedfxSIDC3zq6FzjZsN8Qvfzriakw)

## DISARMING SHOT![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

  

### Sensors

SYSTEM DISRUPTION

At 2nd rank, as a bonus action while deployed as an operator, you can choose a ship that you can see  

As an action, you can expend one power die to attempt

to disarm the target. You add the power die to your ship's next attack roll. On a hit, in addition to the normal damage taken, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you disable a weapon of the target ship of your choice until the ship recharges.

## HACKED COMMUNICATIONS![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

### Comms

As an action, you may expend a power die, and choose any number of ships that you can see within 600 feet of you. Each ship must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take ionic damage equal to the number rolled on the die + your ship's Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, the ship's communication devices are disabled until rebooted.

## REACTOR VULNERABILITY![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

### Comms

When a friendly ship hits a ship with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die as a reaction to temporarily destabilize the ship's reactor. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the ship must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be shocked until the end of its next turn.

## REMOTE SENSORS![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

### Sensors

Whenever you make a Wisdom (Scan) or an Intelligence (Probe) check, you can employ the aid of remote sensors by expending a power die, adding the number rolled to the check. You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.

## SENSOR BLAST![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

### Comms

When a friendly ship hits a target with a weapon attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to attempt to saturate the target's sensors. You add the power die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than your ship until the end of your next turn.

## SYSTEMS BLOCK![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

### Comms

When a friendly ship makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the target’s next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain shield points until the start of your next turn.

## TARGETED STRIKE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z4-_PnNSlwQoI6XH_YQyAG570rvNW6ZowajZ0SXw7O_m8IL124fLJJE3pTnPvVuHw0jUn_vRqpKYsfv3yUSmwTwbT_VyaPLRmELKVtbmPIfWXTiQNP4E-QGj6FAE0X4235EA6QFp-UxFDjQ5gGy4A)

within 1,000 feet and target its systems for disruption. For the next minute, or until you disrupt another target, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check you make to find it.

Additionally, when the ship makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to disrupt the ship's functions. Roll a System Disruption die, which is a d6, and subtract it from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the ship makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your System Disruption die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

IMPROVED INTERFERENCE

Also at 2nd rank, when you use take the Interfere action, you have advantage on the Charisma (Interfere) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

DISRUPTED DEFENSES

At 3rd rank, the first time the target of your System Disruption takes damage each round, it takes additional damage equal to your System Disruption die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

THREAT ASSESSMENT

Also at 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can learn certain information about the capabilities of the target of your System Disruption. The GM tells you if the ship is your ship's equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

An ability score Armor Class

Current total hull and shield points Total ship tiers (if any)

Total deployment ranks (if any)

MASTERFUL INTERFERENCE

At 4th rank, when you take the Interfere action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks or attack rolls it makes before the start of your next turn, instead of one.  

### ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)Sensors

When a friendly ship makes an attack against a target, you can use your reaction to expend a power die. You add the power die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.

  

CHAPTER 2 | DEPLOYMENTS 22  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)HAYWIRE

Also at 4th rank, when you target a ship with your System Disruption feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, while it is the target of your System Disruption feature, the first time it makes an attack roll or a saving throw each round, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oRi4Eiyniq_rG9mEuUKy3BuG7wa2ivdlDGS0qSlGckzWKxTQwxhnopRus8k9OUfCUQwBimRbtKDnMMzC2wWQSDvI2jfwHJpuvBVsWCbQtbyO2t0MuF1CJxb9H8JCF6K69NtFpIudb8u3cKISS1VH_Q)

PARAGON OPERATOR

As of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or a System Disruption die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, you regain all expended uses of your System Disruption feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Lastly, when you would make an Interfere, Scan, or Probe check while deployed as an operator, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

OVERLOAD SYSTEMS

Also at 5th rank, you learn how to overload the systems of a ship remotely. As an action, you can attempt to breach the systems of the target of your System Disruption. The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, the target's flying speed reduced by half, it's turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it's shields no longer regenerate, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.

Regardless of the ship's abilities, crew, or equipment, it can't make more than one attack during its turn.

The ship's pilot makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.

Once you've use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

PILOT

Frantically, the human pilot jukes his x-wing from side-to-side,

trying desperately to shake his tail. In a last ditch effort, the pilot hauls back on the yolk, inverting his fighter, before quickly snapping off two proton torpedoes and vaporizing his opponent.

The sullustan maneuvers his B-Wing into position above the Star Destroyer's shield batteries before dropping his payload. As he turns his craft to flee, he takes one last glance over his shoulder, just in time to see the bombs detonate the shield generator in a massive eruption.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The twi'lek pilot immediately takes evasive maneuvers, dodging the incoming volley, before giving her ships line of fire on the offenders.

Regardless of their choice of career, their origin, and their species, all pilots share one thing in common; the love of flight. They thrive under pressure, be it a dogfight, a bombing run, or smuggler evading the law.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2BZ30639nNQ-wUfXcAPsNi3T99TMWP4rLc5pLm5RLTKUFJ71RbkMxmI1lPttwjx98MRokZJj8aFW1cIOnYxSYOxLzZCXIqdEOxrlXjpp4lUBjaKWTDR2XGZQ5FQNHk5QXRQnQizSWIPzWQnQBo328Q)

VENTURE

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

PILOTING PROCEDURE

Also at 1st rank, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

## TACTICS

You learn two tactics of your choice, which are detailed under "Tactics" below. You can use only one tactic per turn, and you can only use each tactic once per round. You learn an additional tactic at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and

5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new tactic, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.

## POWER DICE

A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the tactic.

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

TACTICS

The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.

### Engines

UNCANNY DODGE

Also at 2nd rank, when an attacker that you can see hits your ship with an attack, you can use your reaction  

As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and

take a defensive formation as long as there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you. When you do so, your AC increases by the amount rolled on the die until the start of your next turn.

## KOIOGRAN TURN![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WK5WLTVPd439QV7LGpwlwAJ8y9--KqaWiacGQvSbP8iPFs8oSk8wZOOqbouza5Df3hWbapuNwYWlPjXp8tX4xpGE6exuz6rUYazK0XKZh14tDhOZTxkvVQz5eFaX-i__ow4go7jpttkPmy2Xf7duCg)

### Engines

When you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a power die and attempt to maneuver out of the line of fire. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. You immediately move that many feet in a direction of your choice. The orientation of your ship does not change.

## SKIM THE SURFACE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WK5WLTVPd439QV7LGpwlwAJ8y9--KqaWiacGQvSbP8iPFs8oSk8wZOOqbouza5Df3hWbapuNwYWlPjXp8tX4xpGE6exuz6rUYazK0XKZh14tDhOZTxkvVQz5eFaX-i__ow4go7jpttkPmy2Xf7duCg)

### Engines

As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and attempt to fly through the space of a hostile ship. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. Your ship's flying speed increases by that amount until the end of your turn. Additionally, moving through a hostile ship's space does not count as hostile terrain this turn.

## SNAP ROLL![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WK5WLTVPd439QV7LGpwlwAJ8y9--KqaWiacGQvSbP8iPFs8oSk8wZOOqbouza5Df3hWbapuNwYWlPjXp8tX4xpGE6exuz6rUYazK0XKZh14tDhOZTxkvVQz5eFaX-i__ow4go7jpttkPmy2Xf7duCg)

### Engines

When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend a power die and attempt to roll to mitigate the damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die.

## STARSHIP CHARGE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WK5WLTVPd439QV7LGpwlwAJ8y9--KqaWiacGQvSbP8iPFs8oSk8wZOOqbouza5Df3hWbapuNwYWlPjXp8tX4xpGE6exuz6rUYazK0XKZh14tDhOZTxkvVQz5eFaX-i__ow4go7jpttkPmy2Xf7duCg)

### Engines

When you take the Ram action, you can expend a power die to increase the damage. On a failed save, the target ship takes additional kinetic damage equal to the amount rolled on the die + your ship's Strength modifier. Your ship has resistance to the additional damage dealt by this tactic.

## TARGET ACQUIRED![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WK5WLTVPd439QV7LGpwlwAJ8y9--KqaWiacGQvSbP8iPFs8oSk8wZOOqbouza5Df3hWbapuNwYWlPjXp8tX4xpGE6exuz6rUYazK0XKZh14tDhOZTxkvVQz5eFaX-i__ow4go7jpttkPmy2Xf7duCg)

### Engines

As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and hone in on a target you can see. The next attack roll made by your ship has advantage, and if the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack's damage roll.

I'LL TRY SPINNING

At 2nd rank, when you use take the Evade action, you can choose to have all attacks against you from a single ship have disadvantage until the beginning of your ship's next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

to halve the attack's damage against your ship.

DEPENDABLE PILOT

Starting at 3rd rank, when you would make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check while assigned as a pilot, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in piloting. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

CUNNING AVOIDANCE

Also at 3rd rank, once per round, when your ship is hit with a ship attack or fails a saving throw, you can make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check, and instead use that value for your AC or saving throw.

THAT'S A GOOD TRICK

At 4th rank, you can take a reaction to give disadvantage to an attack declared against your ship.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

EVASION

Also at 4th rank, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

PARAGON PILOT

As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

PILOT EXTRAORDINAIRE

Also at 5th rank, you are a master at the helm. As a bonus action, you can harness your experience in a brief but awe-inspiring burst. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on Dexterity (Maneuvering) checks, your ship has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against your ship have disadvantage.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

TECHNICIAN

Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby

bulkhead, a Sullustan defense coordinator quickly orders back-up troopers to his position. He peers through his infrared goggles, filtering out the clouds of smoke, ignoring the shouts of his falling comrades as the enemy advances. He raises his own blaster, yelling with anger as the weapon tears into the opposing force. His ship would not be overtaken from within.

Staggering in time with the rocking ship, the ortolan technician rushes down the hallway, hanging wires obstructing her path. As she dodges and jumps over the impediments, she finally reaches the shield generator. With a quick twist of her hydrospanner and a graceless hit with a hammer, she opens the protective cover and reengages the ship's shields. The familiar hum as they power up brings a smile to her lips.

As the flag ship exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. On the bridge, the sounds of a muned explosion can be heard. With practiced ease, the human shield technician jumps to action, calmly angling deflector shields to catch the salvo. Within seconds, the impacts cease, the energy blasts coruscating off the invisible field.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mW2WhVA6fztphoFFpeaX8IXGxoblcm_NLZDuKM_Zj57aSJ8umhcrEQfny558Qir8emq6IAWFZ1Gfkfxa8W6KI8MOd5ycTXJoeI6N4RlZM73NIoqIZJGZMmPCVR14G4mmyGOHILIEy3_yqDpP5BrxmA)

While damage control technicians come from all walks of life, they all share one thing; they gain immense satis- faction from keeping their ship running.

VENTURE

Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

DEFENSE STRATAGEMS

Also at 1st rank, you learn stratagems that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

## STRATAGEMS

You learn two stratagems of your choice, which are detailed under "Stratagems" below. Many stratagems enhance a defense in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each stratagem once per turn.

You learn an additional stratagem at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new stratagem, you can also replace one stratagem you know with a different one.

## POWER DICE

A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the stratagem.

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

STRATAGEMS

The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.

### Shields

When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to redirect some of the impact. Reduce the damage absorbed by your shields by the amount rolled on the power die plus the ship's intelligence modifier.

### Shields

As an action, you can expend one power die to use a hull dice and recover Hull Points. You gain additional Hull Points equal to the amount rolled on the power die.

QUICK REGEN

At 2nd rank, when you take the Boost Shields action, you have advantage on the Strength (Boost) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

SHIP TECHNICIAN

Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one.

DEPENDABLE DAMAGE CONTROL

Starting at 3rd rank, when your ship would make a Constitution Saving throw, you can take take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You may use this feature once before completing a short or long rest.

REROUTE POWER

Additionally, when your ship's shields are fully depleted, you can use your reaction to immediately restore a number of shield points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

RAPID REPAIRMAN

At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiently equipped bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hull Dice, instead of one. For each Hull Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship's Constitution modifier to it.

LAST RESORT

Also at 4th rank, when your ship makes a destruction saving throw, it adds its Constitution modifier to the roll (minimum of +1). Additionally, when you roll a ship's Hull Die to regain hull points or Shield Die to regain shield points, the minimum number of points it can regain from the roll equals twice the ship's constitution modifier (minimum of 2).

PARAGON OF DEFENSE

As of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, when you take the Boost Shields or Patch action, when you would roll to restore hull points or shield points, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll. Once you've used this feature, you must com- plete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

SUPREME SAVE

As of 5th rank, you learn how to quickly isolate massive damage on your ship. As a reaction, when you would otherwise be reduced to zero hull points, you can instead reduce your hull points to one.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

CHAPTER 3: STARSHIPS

haracters are nothing without their ships, which serve as a great source of inspiration and![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qTfp4q6u7uLSzELk7X_ehaCcgGgsU4Bih3pM3joWLbVqYY_61k-ulfkFG4O-BhphUzU1PJy7ZKqjUQujO6AYeXQCUlun-LHPxsS3sn0GS-It7Wpq-t-xWRK6OMd_EY6jl3FYEEpWLMkbMNjPQ7WTSg)

motivation for their adventures. The starship can even be the adventure itself.

The first step is acquisition.

ACQUIRING A SHIP

Many parties might see fit to merely obtain passage on a vessel as a part of their adventures, and there's nothing wrong with that. Others will want to obtain their own ships as fast as possible as it is a core component to their character. It is at the discretion of the GM to determine when a party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options.

JOINING A FACTION

Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the ship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the ship.

SHIPJACKING

The most nefarious (and frankly most enjoyable) way to acquire a starship is to steal one. Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the ship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

PURCHASING

The most common method of acquiring a ship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship can be found below, on the Starship Size Stock Cost table.

Starship Size Stock Cost![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/L4PiM6cI7BWMXdbi-NFr8a4EqzwzXxT6gy4FmCww3GKzol43fjAy72P0NBWNTzsjmObrwJEru_iU2eYvmtlaCqf3ENMZxVQhKpUnKnFK09urDGNMWGDoEM5fyOxXrPbyccqygNQ1HyqZcYu_L0JQCQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PcUCbsTEiB2XSm90qhFGPaEhh5SmR_Qd4sJ9PAqZAinyTNc_deVKdO_lmemqKiK3m-DMFugGkrlKrcQ1-Bw_AfkHchd0UGFvUS417ZuY9bNPHzY3MH7YolRjzqWPT-zcYzBVzOpl_M_a6rDH9SKyTQ)

|Large|1,000,000 cr|
|Huge|100,000,000 cr|
|Gargantuan|1,000,000,000 cr|

  

How the players afford the ship varies as well. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a

||Newly constructed starships come with a number of vacant modification slots, which can be filled with modifications, which are discussed in Chapter 4.||
||   |   |

29 CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS

  

## FINANCING

The party could seek the assistance of a financial institute to purchase a starship. Generally, the bank will require 20% of the starship's cost as a down payment, with monthly payments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years.

## A WEALTHY SPONSOR

Alternatively, the party may be granted the favor of working for a specific wealthy individual, such as a rich aristocrat. Convincing such an individual to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Generally you can only obtain a sponsor if you can prove the relationship will be mutually beneficial.

## LOAN SHARKS

As a less appealing (but potentially more interesting) option, the party could seek out a loan shark or an anuent gangster to finance a ship's acquisition. This usually requires less money up front, but requires steeper loan payments (typically 10% of the starship's cost each month for 3 years).

BUILDING A SHIP

Building a ship is generally cheaper than buying it, but requires substantially more effort and patience; building takes time and necessitates use of a shipyard and a substantial workforce. If players elect to build a stock starship instead of purchasing one, it requires half the cost of the finished ship in facilities, labor costs, and raw materials. Additionally, it requires a minimum workforce as shown below on the Starship Size Building Workforce table. Ship construction also has a maximum practical workforce equal to five times its minimum.

Starship Size Building Workforce

|---|---|
|Tiny|3|
|Small|5|
|Medium|10|
|Large|100|
|Huge|1,000|
|Gargantuan|10,000|

  

The amount of time it takes to build a ship depends on the size of the ship and the size of the workforce, calculated as follows:

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_RlzQHVY5dELEZ0e9s2juPbo5RFGfwCgcBhxsJxwTSKPeIMrMQcCwNpZgIy0E9rHruiBh0WOylN71hjjwedeyWaiJ2kmwIgzUH5HW-JH00gzlgRU24HwZdZMojzup4PoMLiC7abDooU5OA_rTC0D4w)

For instance, to build a Small ship, with a workforce of 5, would take 20 days. To build a Huge ship, with a workforce of 1,000, however, would take 200 days [100,000,000 / (500 x 1,000)].

It is assumed each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day. A workforce more than double the min- imum workforce must work in shifts for further gains.  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)  

UPGRADING A STARSHIP

Once the party has acquired a ship, they can upgrade it over time. Upgrading a ship is a matter of workforce, time, and skill. This assumes the starship you are upgrading is otherwise fully functional (has no missing hull points or damaged systems), the requisite resources and tools are freely available, and you are docked at a spaceport or shipyard. Under less optimal conditions the time, money and skill required could be increased by as much as 100%, and the GM may decide that an upgrade is impossible in these circumstances.

In addition to the cost of modifications and equipment, players can invest credits into their starships, eventually hitting certain thresholds that improve the tier of the ship. Achieving higher tiers requires scarcer materials, restricted schematics, and master craftsmen; consequently, it costs more credits As a player increases the tier of their starship, they unlock additional Hull and Shield Dice, and unique size- specific features. The number of credits a party must invest in their ship varies based on the tier they are trying to obtain, as show below in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

COST MODIFIERS

It costs more to upgrade the hull of a capital ship than the hull of a starfighter; bigger starships are simply costlier to improve. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table below, which is multiplied by the value for that tier in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

Starship Size Upgrade Cost![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/dpb1P9J_lbb_SxDGARfy2euXLMty6Pjzuz7wZPrJl92rIzphLiGvy3Cw3k6byGz_uOR9W-fr3FEPi9_RABXbOi-s8K6aSccFYpj8n0gtLkv7id4g8iqHIq8XcRaN3pNfM4dCbdf9UfmqxPEfed5EWQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Kpa3q1tjC55FShCH9mqJ8Uc_K9F9iziV3VZOQFAhCocPNcYWQbPDc3S1pMbFVY3GrQfIX1OU952wIsDUZwx5-HEpJfP81uR7Mq8Vl94i51K6Te3eksX-FGvuLCSW0eKHl9i48lkS3WW0RX1-6w2W0A)

|Small|x 1|
|Medium|x 2|
|Large|x 10|
|Huge|x 100|
|Gargantuan|x 1,000|

  

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from Tier 0 to Tier 1, it costs 3,900 credits. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, however, it costs 29,700,000 (297,000 x 100).

UPGRADE WORKFORCE

Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform these upgrades. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additional workers will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table below.

UPGRADE TIME

With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be upgraded in no more than a week's time. However, upgrading a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n2V_VjrPsnWpIKOTPr3jHVKX1L5sK_k41xymN5sItIxgAznCSo2zRCSbi8nEeUcXUbWaHDTUr4qAEIsqJCu7uAsrfmzBQwkeWho-CePAr5wCRyQ8Xl4QMobfObX8gk7nRw3a8RxnjXlJA7Rs3QEm5Q)

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from tier 0 to tier 1, with a workforce of 3, would take 2.6 days. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, with a workforce of 500, however, would take 118.8 days [(297,000 x 100) / (500 x 500)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce

|---|---|---|
|works 8 hours per day.|   |   |
||Some starship features are only usable once per round. Once they have been used by a deployed crew member, they are not available for use again until the start of that crew member's next turn.||

Once players have upgraded a ship to tier 1 or higher, they unlock additional features, determined by the ship's size.

TINY SHIPS

As the droid fighter ducked and weaved through flying

blaster bolts and dodged the occasional flak, its optical sensors continued to become more and more occluded as they accumulated a dark haze of dust and smoke. Switching to active radar systems, the droid continued to relentlessly pursue its target: the fleeing Jedi and its small padawn that was barely larger than a youngling. Not that it mattered. Whether either target continued to draw breath a few seconds from now didn't really matter to the droid. Of course, that cessation was its goal, but it didn't really care about that goal...it's just what it was doing. What it had to do. But not exactly what it wanted to do. The droid passed power from its fully charged weapon's capacitors into its guns, which blazed to life and spewed plasma towards the small child's back. It was a perfect shot.

How could it not be. That's what it did. Then the Jedi's

own plasma weapon flared as it darted across the youngling's back, deflecting the droid's blasts directly back at it. Of course, that is what Jedi's did. And as the bolts tore through the droid ship's hull, into its main computer banks, across its power banks and out its engines, the droid's final computations let it know that it was plummeting to the earth at terminal velocity. It's just what it was doing. What it now had to do. But not exactly what it wanted to do.

The small drone slips silently past the blockade, scanning the defensive formations as it goes. The only chance to save the people on embattled Neth-Feeno was to coordinate a supply drop with them. This little, remote-controlled stealth ship was their only hope. It had to reach the surface to get the plan and maps through. Then it had to return with a full readout of the defenses. Only then could a distracting assault be planned to cover the air drop. As the tiny craft floated past the final sensor pod mounted right next to the final turret canon, the monitoring crew let out a sigh, and wiped sweat from their brows. As their screens, already more static than signal, winked out as the craft's transmissions were cut-off as it passed completely into the black-out zone, the team leader turned to his squad and said, "May the force be with us today."

One thing all Tiny starships have in common is that they are unmanned. Sometimes they are controlled remotely, but more often they are controlled by droids.

SMALL SHIPS

As the fighters cover his approach, Zik Beskin activates his

targeting computer and ignores the explosions surrounding him, instead Focusing on the Destroyer's shield generator. It had to come down soon, or this fight was lost. Arsix, behind him, beeps and whirs, preparing the ion pulse missiles for the attack run, pre- warming their engines and arming the warheads.

Together a long time now, Beskin and Arsix had spilled their share of blood and oil, respectively, for the Rebellion--usually just while improving their ancient Y- wing. But today, the blood and oil spilt wouldn't be their own. As Zik let fly a pair of missiles, he knew they would find their target. Today wasn't over just yet.

This was her fourth sortie of the day, and Sheena was tired. The terrorists just kept coming. Every time she was about to shut her eyes a new wave of the Rebels came. And every time they did, she rushed to her TIE Interceptor and joined the alert fighters to take the fighters down before they could blow a hole in the planet's defenses. Every time they retreated before suffering heavy losses. But every time they came back. This last time she had decided to just nap in the cramp-

  

ed cockpit, so when the claxon rang out, she and her ship were basically ready to fly. This time she was go- ing to end them quickly. As she repeatedly squeezed her trigger, she executed Koiogran turns and snap rolls galore, her laser blasts striking true, and the debris of A-wings, X-wings, and B-Wings--along with some frozen traitor remains--floated in space the next few days. At night, she leaned back against her beau, sipping some wine and watch-ing the beautiful streaks of light cross the sky as, piece by piece, the wreckage burned up in the atmosphere during reentry.

R5-S1 locked down the loose stabilizer with his gripper arm as he angled the X-Wing's deflector shields. This ship took a firm gripper to get under control, but R5-S1 was up to the task. As his pilot, Veets, fired his last blast from the overheating cannons on the deployed s-foils, R5-S1 did the work of cooling off the guns, spooling up the hyperdrive, and running the calculations for lightspeed. It was time to go.

Small ships have a tiny crew, often only a pilot and perhaps an astromech, but often strike above their weight class, a threat to small and large ships alike.

STARSHIP IMPROVEMENTS

Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

## ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 22, with this feature.

## ADDITIONAL HULL AND SHIELD DICE

Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).

PINPOINT STRIKE

Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to slip underneath the shields of an enemy ship.

When your ship occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and the pilot makes an attack roll, as a reaction, the pilot can, before rolling the attack, roll a Pinpoint Strike die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll. If the attack requires a saving throw instead, you may subtract the Pinpoint Strike die from the target's save result. On a hit, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used by the pilot, and it can only be used once per round.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fmgiywLvIDpM9F8UrqzyW9MSOqRiRX1x-IHkjrwZhB78CpEYWiAaYwpMz4gm835Zz4l5SOMBGgGcfMO2bfpLQK9tC-F39Cl5jF0-THFtbaom2JNbMiTHX-RU4RZsoPahFxqSSHi1M8YUGRdoIIBmRQ)

Your ship’s Pinpoint Strike die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship’s tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

ROLE SPECIALIZATION

At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## BOMBER

Your ship gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

## INTERCEPTOR

Your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

## SCOUT

Your ship gains a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Scan) and Intelligence (Probe) checks.

## SCRAMBLER

Your ship's crew can use interfere as a bonus action.

## SHUTTLE

Your ship gains one suite system of your choice at no cost. Your Starship Size Suite Capacity is 2.

## STRIKE FIGHTER

Your ship gains a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and save DCs of its ship weapons.

RETRO THRUSTERS

Also at 2nd tier, when an attacker that a deployed pilot or operator can see deals damage to your ship with a weapon, they can use their reaction to immediately move the ship up to 50 feet in a direction of their choice, halving the damage your ship takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

VERSATILE SNUBFIGHTER

Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

MANEUVERING JETS

Also at 3rd tier, your ship can add half of its Dexterity modifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to its armor class.

ROLE MASTERY

At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## BOMBER

Starships one or more sizes larger than you have disadvantage on saving throws against your tertiary and quaternary weapons.

## INTERCEPTOR

Your ship's turning speed decreases by 50 feet. If this would decrease your ship's turning speed to 0, instead your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

## SCOUT

Your ship gains a +2 bonus to Intelligence (astrogation) checks and enemy ships have disadvantage on Wisdom (scan) checks to detect your ship entering and exiting hyperspace.

## SCRAMBLER

Your ship gains a +2 bonus to Charisma (interference) checks.

## SHUTTLE

Your ship gains one suite system of your choice at no cost. Your Starship Size Suite Capacity is 2.

## STRIKE FIGHTER

Your ship's shield regeneration rate is doubled.

STANDING BY

Also at 4th tier, your ship can be pushed beyond its normal limits for a moment. On their turn, a deployed crew member can take one additional action on top of their regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

PARAGON SNUBFIGHTER

As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Choose from the following:

## BOMBER

Your ship's Wisdom score increases by 2. It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

## INTERCEPTOR

Your ship's Dexterity score increases by 2. It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

## SCOUT

Your ship's Intelligence score increases by 2. It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

A LEAF ON THE WIND

Also at 5th tier, when your ship, or a deployed crew member, makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, a deployed crew member can use their reaction to treat the amount rolled on the d20 as a 20.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

MEDIUM SHIPS

The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite

its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. The technician's efforts to reinforce the shields are failing. The mechanic is pumping the reactor for every scrap of energy it can generate. The operator is frantically making the final few calculations for the jump to hyperspace. Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of with- standing the salvo, drop the tractor beam and retreat. As the gunboat pursues to be sure the pirates don't come back for a second bite at the apple, the crew finally locks on target and unleashes a long-range night-stinger missile, putting a permanent end to the pirates' illicit and unwelcome activities.

The captain invites his guests into his well-stocked cantina. He eyes the opposition as they take in his ship, assessing their reactions and noting their expressions. Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he easily stifles his grin and gestures for the starry-eyed vis-itors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident this deal will go his way. He presses a button on the tiny remote in his hand, causing hidden panels to slide away and reveal his mostly-legal wares. "So," he says, "just how many of these do you need, and where will I deliver them?"

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close- knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

STARSHIP IMPROVEMENTS

Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

## ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores above 20, with this feature.

## ADDITIONAL HULL AND SHIELD DICE

Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).

EVASIVE MANEUVERS

Also at 1st tier, when a deployed pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.

Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WuyAOWsMbYwb0S9T2IrecjycsxBd56E3CgjYjEu9KfwJRKKsTJcaC77V_x_Wczqogl708-5hEdvWSs_2jdAfBhD8_DObKuTR39nt5_PjtuQ-eZ4nBVOsXDkn5snyj-dU1kV8wI6PAzAB6uMUsrThpg)

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

37 CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS  

ROLE SPECIALIZATION

At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## COURIER

Your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

## FREIGHTER

Your ship gains the Storage Compartment modification at no cost, which does not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, your ship's base cargo capacity increases to 50 tons.

## GUNBOAT

Your ship gains a Fixed Hardpoint modification at no cost. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

## MISSILE BOAT

Starships one or more sizes larger than you have disadvantage on saving throws against your tertiary and quaternary weapons.

## NAVIGATOR

Your ship gains the Navcomputer modification at no cost. Additionally, if a crew member must roll on the Hyperspace Mishaps table, they can roll twice and choose either total.

## YACHT

Your ship gains the Recreation modification at no cost, which does not count against its total suite systems.

Additionally, while hosting guests on your ship, they have disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks.

NIMBLE STARSHIP

Also at 2nd tier, your ship can add half its Dexterity modifier (minimum of one) to any saving throw it makes that doesn't already include that modifier.

VERSATILE TRANSPORT

Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

HOLD TOGETHER

Also at 3rd tier, when your ship takes damage while at 0 hull points, it makes a Destruction saving throw, instead of automatically failing.

ROLE MASTERY

At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## COURIER

Your ship gains the Backup Hyperdrive modification at no cost. Any installed hyperdrive operates as one of the next faster class. If you have a class 0.5 hyperdrive installed, it acts as a 0.4 hyperdrive.

## FREIGHTER

When your ship fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a deployed crew member can use their reaction to jettison some of the cargo stored in its storage compartments. If you jettison at least 50 tons of cargo, you can reroll the saving throw and must use the new roll. If you jettison at least 75 tons of cargo, however, you instead automatically succeed on the saving throw. Additionally, the area in a line 300 feet long and 100 feet wide behind your ship becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

## GUNBOAT

Once per round, a deployed gunner can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship attack.

## MISSILE BOAT

When firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can load each weapon with multiple types of munitions up to your reload number and select which to fire when you take the attack action with that weapon.

## NAVIGATOR

Your ship has resistance to damage from environmental effects, and advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of environmental effects.

## YACHT

You have advantage Charisma checks made against those who can see your ship.

ADAPTIVE ARMOR

Also at 4th tier, when your ship is hit with an attack roll, a deployed pilot can add the ship's Constitution modifier to AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

PARAGON TRANSPORT

As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Two of your ship's ability scores increase by 2. It's maximums for these scores increase by two.

BEST SHIP IN THE 'VERSE

Also at 5th tier, as an action, a deployed crew member can give the ship resistance to unenhanced damage from ship weapons for 1 minute.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

LARGE SHIPS

Trapped in the capital ship's tractor beam, the ambassador

frigate moves slowly towards the cruiser. The crew struggles to squeeze more power out of their reactor while the few marines on board take positions next to the hatches, wiping sweat from their brows as they check and re-check their weapons. Finally, bringing all the power the ship has to bare, the frigate is able to break the hold of the tractor beam and regain its trajectory, slowly but surely increasing the distance, before finally escaping the planet's moon and being able to jump to hyperspace. Shouts of joy echo down the ship's corridors and extra rations are ordered in celebration.

Engines burning brightly, the corvette sprints through the blockade, trying to minimize the amount of fire its meager shields will have to absorb. Top and bottom turrets swivel to port, unleashing return fire against inbound interceptors. The ground drops from under everyone's feet as the artificial gravity systems flicker for a second as a pulse weapon detonates nearby. The high-pitched, distant whine of the reactor is barely audible over commands issuing from the bridge. The visual readouts indicated that they were now past the picket line, and the interceptors appeared to be breaking off, unsure of their ability to take on the much larger ship without the support of their battle stations. They'd made it. Looking back at the scopes, the coordinator's head hung down. They'd been the only ones to do so.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

As the Pelta-Class Picket ship danced between the larger destroyers and dreadnaughts, it continued its near constant barrage of heavy laser cannon fire, interspersed with individual launches of concussion missiles and proton torpedoes directed at vulnerable parts of the opposing fleet. If too many of those enemy guns came to bear on the the Pelta, it would be in trouble, but it's speed and it's relatively limited firepower made it a less-than juicy target. For now. But that is exactly what it's captain needed. Just a few more clicks and they would be in a perfect flanking position, able to pound the engines of the flag ship as soon as it's shields were brought down by the bombing squad beginning their run now.

Large ships occupy the pinnacle of size for most private owner/operators in the galaxy. Large ships require an extensive crew and are costly to maintain, but can pack quite a punch and may house various suites and operation centers that allow the ship to operate as an impressive and mobile base of operations for wealthy individuals and successful adventurers.

STARSHIP IMPROVEMENTS

Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

## ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Constitution above 20, or your Constitution above 22, with this feature.

BLOCKADE RUNNER

Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to react to damage from large ships.

As a reaction to being hit with an attack roll from a Large or larger ship, a deployed pilot can use their reaction to immediately move the ship forward an amount equal to half its flying speed (rounded down) and then roll a Blockade Runner die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)

## CORVETTE

Your ship gains a Fixed Hardpoint modification at no cost. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

## CRUISER

Starships one or more sizes larger than you have disadvantage on saving throws against your tertiary and quaternary weapons.

## EXPLORER

Your ship gains the Scanner, Premium modification at no cost. Additionally, the range of its scanners is increased by 1,000 feet.

CONCENTRATED FIRE

Also at 2nd tier, once per turn, when you attack a ship of size Large or larger, and it was previously hit by an allied ship of size Large or larger's weapons since the end of its last turn, you have advantage on the attack. If you already had disadvantage, you may instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).

VERSATILE FRIGATE

Starting at 3rd tier, when a crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with the ship, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

SUPER-HEAVY TURBOLASER BATTERY

Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a forward- mounted special version of a Turbolaser. Your ship is considered to meet this weapon's constitution requirement regardless of your ship's constitution ability score. The damage dealt by this Turbolaser is 3d12.

This weapon does not utilize or count as a weapon hardpoint.

## PICKET SHIP

The close and long ranges of your point defense systems increase by 100 feet. Additionally, Large or smaller ships have disadvantage on saving throws against your point defense systems.

## SHIP'S TENDER

Your ship gains the Nano-Droid Distributor modification at no cost. Additionally, the range of its effects is increased by 400 feet.

TACTICAL RETREAT

Also at 4th tier, when a crew member rolls a 1 on an Intelligence (Astrogation) check to calculate astrogation, or a Constitution saving throw to maintain the hyperdrive booting, they can reroll the die. They must use the new roll.

PARAGON FRIGATE

As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Three of your ship's ability scores increase by 2. Its maximum for these scores increases by 2.

HUGE SHIPS

The battleship's shields flicker as it absorbs the blows of the

attacking fighters. It continues inexorably past them as it's point-defense system peppers it's vicinity with blaster fire to ward them off. As it a approaches the fragile medical frigate the fighters scramble to protect, its gunners lock on to the target before unleashing a fierce volley of turbolaser fire and snapping it in half.

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy from its hangars in formations and move to intercept the space station's patrol fighters. Before the enemy craft have the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks. But before the snubfighters had even left the carrier, a second wave of small bombers had been prepping for takeoff. As they spew forth from the hangars, they quickly lock on to the space station and launch proton bombs, pulverizing the station in minutes.

  

With the command given, the operator activates the interdictor's gravity well projectors. the lights inside dim almost imperceptibly as huge amounts of power is drawn from the reactor core and supplemental capacitors to the projectors. Accompanied by a low- pitched hum, the gravity well projectors power up.

Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them. The ship then activates its tractor beam, trapping its quarry.

Huge starships, regardless of their specific purpose, are the backbone of any military. They provide a mobile base of operations and function as a staging ground for the faction that controls them.

GARGANTUAN SHIPS

The smaller ships retreat into the shadow of the blockade

ship, fleeing an overwhelming foe. As the dread- nought's shields envelope them, they quickly turn and spring on their pursuers, utilizing the bulwark's shields as they unleash all of the firepower they have to bear. Meanwhile, the blockade ship unleashes a storm of electromagnetic energy from its antenna array, cutting of communications between enemy ships, effectively isolating the incoming forces from their distant fleet and from each other.

In the center of the fleet, the command ship surveys the battlefield. Wherever the line wavers, the command ship quickly directs ships to reinforce.

Finally, the formations of the enemy flag, and the command ship directs the fleet to capitalize on their failure as it determines and uploads targeting coordinates to its torpedo ships.

  

The warship looms ominously over the battlefield as the two opposing armies crash. Despite the efforts of the enemy line, the warship closes into firing range of the capital ships. Having already determined an ordered targeting precedence, the operating crew confirms final firing solutions for the gunners as they charge up the main super-weapon on the prow of the ship. It unleashes its first devastating blast as the rest of its arsenal begins to lance out at secondary targets nearby.

Gargantuan ships are the dreadnoughts that strike fear into the hearts of the faithless. They are the embodiment of indomitable might: a symbol of total and complete control.

STARSHIP IMPROVEMENTS

Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

## ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Constitution above 20, or your Constitution above 26, with this feature.

## ADDITIONAL HULL AND SHIELD DICE

Your ship gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice. It gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice at 2nd tier (4, each), 3rd tier (6, each), 4th tier (8, each), and 5th tier (10, each).

SUPERIOR FIREPOWER

Also at 1st tier, your starship's firepower can overwhelm larger ships.

When a crew member deals damage to a Large or larger ship with a ship weapon, the crew member can increase the damage by rolling a Superior Firepower die, which is a d4, and add it to the damage roll (no action required).

Your ship's Superior Firepower die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes recharging.

47 CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS  

ROLE SPECIALIZATION

At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## BLOCKADE SHIP

Your ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 500 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 500 feet away from your ship and your ship's shields are active, your ship's shields instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your ship's shields to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.

## FLAG SHIP

Your ship gains the Command Center suite and Tractor Beam modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, when a crew member deployed in a command center takes the Direct action, the target of the Direct action can reroll one of the dice once.

## INDUSTRIAL CENTER

Your ship gains two Workshop modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems.

Additionally, the speed at which goods are crafted in your workshops is doubled.

## MOBILE METROPOLIS

Your ship gains a Living Quarters suite and a Recreation suite at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your Living Quarters are doubled.

## RESEARCHER

Your ship gains the Laboratory and Workshop modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, Intelligence (Lore) checks on your ship are made with advantage.

## WARSHIP

Your ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

PRIME DOCTRINE

Also at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When crew members roll initiative, one crew member can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crew member deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw contested by a Charisma (Menace) check. On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

VERSATILE DREADNOUGHT

Starting at 3rd tier, when a crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

SUPERWEAPON

Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 15d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

ROLE MASTERY

At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## BLOCKADE SHIP

Your ship's shield regeneration rate doubles.

## FLAG SHIP

A coordinator deployed in a command center can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

## INDUSTRIAL CENTER

Your ship gains two Docking Bay suites at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your docking bays are doubled.

## MOBILE METROPOLIS

Your ship's fuel capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Fuel Capacity table, and storage capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Storage Capacity table, doubles.

Additionally, while traveling in realspace, your ship consumes half the amount of fuel as normal.

## RESEARCHER

When you use your ship's Superweapon, you can alter its functionality. Instead of dealing damage, ships who fail a saving throw are blinded, shocked, and shocked for 1 minute. Ships who succeed on the saving throw suffer these effects until the start of the deployed operator's next turn, instead.

## WARSHIP

When a deployed gunner on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.

CITADEL

Also at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled. If a suite type's capacity was already doubled, its size is instead tripled from its standard size.

Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crew members, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion. If the capacity for fuel and/or consumables was already double its standard amount, it is now triple its original capacity.

PARAGON DREADNOUGHT

As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Two of your ship's ability scores increase by 4, and its maximum for these scores increase by 4. Another ability score increases by 2, and its maximum for this score increases by 2.

DEVASTATOR

Also at 5th tier, as an action, a single crew member can give the ship the following benefits for 1 minute:

Your ship has resistance to all damage.

Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.

Players may decide they want to invest in a space station. Only size categories Large and larger are appropriate for space stations. If players elect to own a space station instead of—or in addition to—a starship, use the following rules.

## ARMOR CLASS

When calculating a space station's armor class, space stations receive a -2 penalty to their AC.

## STOCK MODIFICATIONS

Your space station comes with the Central Computer, Makeshift universal system in addition to the other stock modifications.

## FLYING SPEED AND TURNING SPEED

The station's flying speed become 50 feet and it's turning speed becomes 100 feet, regardless of any bonuses or penalties. The station's flying speed and turning speed can never be increased or decreased.

## HULL POINTS PER HULL DIE

For each Hull Die a space station has, it gains 2 additional hull points.

## HYPERSPACE TRAVEL

Your travel time in hyperspace is doubled.

## MODIFICATION INSTALLATION DC

Space Stations have a -10 adjustment to the DC to install a modification.

## STARSHIP SIZE MAXIMUM SUITES

The maximum number of suites a station can have (based on their size and constitution modifier) doubles. For instance, a Large ship with a 17 constitution (+3) has a maximum of 9 suites, and a Large station with the same constitution score instead has a maximum of 18 suites.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DHuJxHk5D6hH22q0A0_myu9LFRGc7ZmgEjFtHqnJzGaW33a3MKPpTDylydbQn4sYWUZe-arVBTlbJvW5HP7M2wyKjl_zP04oE8kdLIHgNTKvrZF55kxJJht233ZuJZ1e55owwKTPQlQddJV-s_JN1Q)

SPACE STATION TIER FEATURES

When players upgrade a space station to certain tier levels, they can choose from the following feature options, instead of those available only to starships.

ROLE SPECIALIZATION

At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## SPACE STATION (LARGE)

Your station gains the Central Computer, Makeshift modification at no cost. Additionally, when a crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their Intelligence modifier is less than that of the station's Intelligence modifier, they can instead use the station's Intelligence modifier to Technology checks.

## SPACE STATION (HUGE)

Your station gains the Central Computer, Makeshift; Central Computer, Mark 1; and Comms Package, Premium modifications at no cost. Additionally, when a crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their Intelligence modifier is less than that of the station's Intelligence modifier, they can instead use the station's Intelligence modifier to Technology checks.

## SPACE STATION (GARGANTUAN)

Your station gains the Central Computer, Makeshift; Central Computer, Mark 1; and Comms Package, Prototype modifications at no cost. Additionally, when a crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their Intelligence modifier is less than that of the station's Intelligence modifier, they can instead use the station's Intelligence modifier to Technology checks.

ROLE MASTERY

At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

## SPACE STATION (ALL SIZES)

When a crew member on your station is targeted by the Interfere action, they have advantage on the ship's Wisdom saving throw made to avoid it. If they already have advantage, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

they want to modify it. The desire for faster hyperdrives, more weapons, better shields, and possibly even some space for smuggled goods generally comes before the first payment to a Hutt loan shark is due. Upgrading and modifying a starship gives players a sense of ownership that makes them more connected to a campaign, and it serves other useful purposes as well.

Heroes who want to improve a starship have a built-

in reason to take risks to earn credits (or other re- wards, such as the use of the repair bay of a grateful military group). Although Star Wars focuses on on heroic action-adventure over the cobbling together of credits for tinkering with a ship, many characters are simply more motivated if they know there's a material reward on the line. Furthermore, a starship acts as a good base of operations, allowing heroes to have a place that seems like home even as they gallivant across the galaxy. Finally, as the heroes gain levels, a better-equipped ship prepares them for greater challenges.

MODIFYING A STARSHIP

When ships are produced, they are left with a certain amount of extra space, superstructure and power consumption leftover to facilitate the addition of new system modifications and suites. In addition to the costs associated with acquiring raw materials, components and installation, each one of these modifications consumes one of a ship's modification slots. This section details all of the system modifications available to a ship. There are five categories of modifications, discussed later in this chapter.

When players acquire a new ship, it typically comes with minimal modifications already installed. Players then choose the modifications they want installed on their ship. Like construction and upgrading, installing new systems and modifying old ones takes materials, time, and a substantial workforce. Even with the requisite components, the GM may decide that a modification is inaccessible; it might only be obtainable if the heroes get hold of it directly, by recovering it from a supply depot, trading it off of a collector, or stealing it from the manufacturer.

The cost of a modification depends on the category from which it comes, as shown below in the Modification Category Cost table.

SIZE MODIFIERS

In the same way it costs more to upgrade a capital ship than a starfighter, it costs more to modify it as well.

Each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Modification Cost table below:

For instance, to purchase and install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, it costs 3,000 credits. To purchase and install one on a Huge ship, however, it costs 150,000 (3,000 x 50).

Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform modifications. For a Small ship, two people can do everything necessary (though additional staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Modification Workforce table.

## MODIFICATION CAPACITY BY SHIP SIZE![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/aTN40qylHdNVC5eWw3JrUD08pSOz68-g_BcyJ-Lkj_PJnr9fzlKE-PMgWyDagMdghLeYxvNCeig8BtpDk1uc9DgMb3YAfcndPpPhlMc8YnHmH6KhYTqcIFOTj0XThLZqP2KOrjj1bPFjsz5LBxs9bw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_E7Is8FUfW7flaXfTD25_92hikBnRXlGgtLVLNSCn5de-j63aAJ4dw33QvmqicMBFrcRqLiciM1-1yeV6-NP4U6_mJ6EAkiWBvrZQgfmBMnnOwEPvSpg45lbsOmpksGKEeimLPaeT6_YJBw0rjPzmQ)

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tiny|10|
|Small|20|
|Medium|30|
|Large|50|
|Huge|60|
|Gargantuan|70|

  

However, if you lack sufficient modification slots to support a modification, you can still add it, if you are willing to spend more time and credits for installing all the space and subsystems required to support the modification. For every modification slot you manually add to your ship, add 50% to the modification category base cost. Additionally, for every modification you install over your modification capacity, add a cumulative 2 to the installation DC for a tiny to medium ship, and a cumulative 1 to the installation DC for a large to gargantuan ship.

MODIFICATION TIME

With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be modified in no more than a week's time. However, a new modification layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to modify a starship is calculated as follows:

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sy9S2Ae2lP8YpFOoxynzLJe1O7aqC6yq3YqUAhrGHYAD8CKnrXjsZtjrJ7fii99-KoxQf9fww7NZAiukf4NYvWRmycFk8o5gBA0XrGt90Om4FiFj1wWx2bHonF1fqa-91FIWn8eAaSNnz6WjixbsOA)

For instance, to install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, with a workforce of 2, it takes three days. To install one on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, it also takes 3 days.

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

MODIFICATION GRADE AND SHIP TIER

Finally, modifications have a grade (0 if not listed). High-grade modifications are more costly, using scarce materials to construct and install. When purchasing and installing a modification with a listed grade, multiply the final cost of the modification by the modification’s grade and add that amount to the final cost. As an example, a Grade 2 modification would have two times the final cost added to that final cost, resulting in a total installation cost of three times that of a modification without a listed Grade.

Additionally, these modifications require more precise skill to install, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table. However, ships of higher quality (high tier) make it easier to install these high-quality (high grade) modifications.

MODIFICATION INSTALLATION CHECK

When making a modification, the foremost mechanic must make an Intelligence (Mechanic’s Kit) check to correctly install modifications. The DC for the check varies based on the grade of the modification and the tier of the ship, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table below.

On a failure, half the requisite time and cost is incurred, but the modification is not installed.

PREREQUISITES

Some modifications have prerequisites that must be met before they can be installed.

If at any time you lose access to a modification's prerequisite, such as removal or ship damage, you can't use that modification again until you regain access to the prerequisite.

ABILITY SCORE MAXIMUMS

If a tier feature or modification would increase an ability score above its maximum without also increasing that maximum, you can instead allocate that additional ability score increase to another ability score.

CHANGING SAVING THROW PROFICIENCY 

When a starship is created, a saving throw proficiency may be chosen from a list available to the starship.

Later on, however, players may want to change their starship's saving throw proficiency to another of the available options. Changing a saving throw proficiency requires time and credits as if installing a new universal modification.

REMOVING MODIFICATIONS

Sometimes, characters might decide they want to remove a modification in favor of a new one. Removing a modification requires half the cost it takes to install the modification originally, and takes half the time.

REMOVING TIERS

Sometimes, characters might decide they want to change a selection made for a starship tier feature. To do so, they must remove the tier from the ship, reducing the ship's tier by one. Doing so removes all features from the ship earned at the new tier, including Ability Score Improvements, additional Hull and Shield Dice, and additional modifications.

Removing a starship tier requires half the cost it takes to upgrade to that tier, and takes half the time.

If upgrading the ship to the tier again at the same time as removal, the additional time to remove is incurred, but the cost to remove is not required.

STARSHIP TIER FEATURES

If a modification is granted to your starship by a starship tier feature, such as the Role Specialization feature, that modification does not require an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check, comes at no additional cost, and you can't voluntarily remove it. It does, however, take up a modification slot. If your starship already has that modification, you may install an additional modification that is available to you and of equal or lesser grade instead.

STOCK MODIFICATIONS

Also at tier 0, each ship comes with a number of modifications, at no additional cost, depending on its size, as shown in chapter 3. These modifications do take up modification slots.

MODIFICATION CATEGORIES

There are five categories of modification. Each category has separate rules governing its use.

ENGINEERING SYSTEMS

These modifications offer unique functionality to the ship. Each engineering system can be chosen multiple times.

OPERATION SYSTEMS

These specialized modifications aid in the operation and response of the ship. Each operation system can be chosen only once.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OQt-Ihpa_E0wbfYT0EwNMo9XA-asa5z_jAkD78fO4DVKqf_aO3WaZzkrz-4ka-90gesU5Hf2z6A303mPsuD76hBdApgk2jfgh09anYTeTc3JM3W73H3kjc_Tju4evC8C4hevr9l3Mm7HtUDp-I13JA)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zmj1yJWcupwBtmS2KAOCC_P8-P86DBLF_AThb6P8hRCMA0bVtt8JHxYRM3ljeNEwM5UdbAMVC1TFUl5fbnpIxOJir27ScdyQ7Ii7r8sKsNFUu5zoMOrGUblIYcaVYFfavEwFp9uVpnarCSYeE0DBzg)

SUITE SYSTEMS

Suite systems add additional functionality to the ship in the form of bays, stations and designated areas, offering increased utility to civilians, crew members, and troopers. Each suite system can be chosen no more than ten times. All suite systems require a ship of size Small or larger. In addition to their modification slot cost, ships are limited to the number of suite systems they can have, depending on the ship's size and constitution modifier, as shown below in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table.

UNIVERSAL SYSTEMS

These modifications offer passive benefits to the ship as a whole. Each Universal System can be chosen only once.

WEAPON SYSTEMS

These modifications deal with the installation and improvement of weapon systems. Each weapon system can be chosen multiple times.

A ship is proficiently equipped by having the weapon system installed, therefore any crew member using a system can add their proficiency bonus when the weapon system indicates.

ENGINEERING SYSTEMS

The systems are presented in alphabetical order. If a system has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the system at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

ADVANCED SLAM

### Modification Grade: 3![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/56rRigc8dAcuQ7sy_s2m02js9Pk-U4fSuD1Vyarl2JE9MdgPg7-B7tb9TN4PWBGyBe_iqbGRrKEZLmrAwHqY7n7_3p9ZnJldC5HdA2qPjs4a01l-7om7GTvpkJdrUnJI9znbVaeaOpz6lFKFcmcZzg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/p61sk0ClCAIdfRzGwwdvbCUKJIWYW4FTogRJC0TGtViIJtRZ-vgTKa9DX9mTdtpUQk8Ra9RKJjXh5qUVt_oWjHVund-TwvWCPJq00YwZTj55Sw6HnqDe34BG-WqfMLar3tOBwxmX1Hd_7PlHDOYHWQ)

### SLAM

Your ship's SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM) has been enhanced, granting more utility. When a pilot takes the Dash action, the increase now equals twice your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 900 feet on its turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 450 feet this turn if you dash.

This action still affects your entire ship: any skill check or attack roll made by your ship or anyone on it has disadvantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

ALTERNATIVE FUEL CONVERTER

Your ship is equipped with an alternative fuel converter which allows the conversion of materials to a potential fuel source. Over the course of 10 minutes, a crew member can make a constitution (Regulation) check (DC = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one day's worth of fuel.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

AUTOMATED PROTOCOLS

### Modification Grade: 2![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/56rRigc8dAcuQ7sy_s2m02js9Pk-U4fSuD1Vyarl2JE9MdgPg7-B7tb9TN4PWBGyBe_iqbGRrKEZLmrAwHqY7n7_3p9ZnJldC5HdA2qPjs4a01l-7om7GTvpkJdrUnJI9znbVaeaOpz6lFKFcmcZzg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a1NWMmhDN8XiAxTpobjMMUIlbNl9nmUXNjXFOdWGzfabDZC7bv_0-U7vQBwjBWR73mRTwfnFh6sjo_e10lWTY8I_xv-a0cNe96_aCvhw_7dAdyXhW0ykzChNlzRVAHJEB4BcMG77LXqVTZWMFOnuPw)

### Damage Control System

You upgrade your damage control system. A crew member can take the Patch action as a reaction. This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, you can add your ship's intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to whenever you roll hull dice to regain hull points.

Finally, your ship is expertly equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

BOARDING HARPOON

### Modification Grade: 2![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jMsQ5oAun4tHXP_8z0N5FSxyLwpeCTWlkxdzxu0alvz7Zy_38XGSU4dKHrPbvf_9CQyl-r-8hrq46m4Cg4nk_Y6G7cP7lrVeY46ZHLP4J20OGl8MUj0jQcK94szE3QRqlTzpCrlJFueU8kbQ_MkMiA)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bfQCc4Q33BE_SIRNXrDd9IZa7z-ua4zjeH9TG3ZivBV5XBEzQuRrL_5NgT7IjkOc7m3IsqfQ3b2i0-uleFN-SQWJLLkA1NzdIcR8NUsVnBfyKgcGw0_5B4-_AOOCd8lVrpy4WwwIUEGkZQxgvEt48Q)

### Hardened Prow

Your ship has been further modified with a massive grappling harpoon, through which creatures can pass. Your ship is expertly equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.

Additionally, when a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, on a hit, they become harpooned. While harpooned, the target ship's flying speed is reduced to 0, and your ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Your ship's pilot can release the harpooned ship at any time (no action required). The harpooned ship is automatically released if your ship becomes disabled, or if it is forcefully moved more than 100 feet away from your ship.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yLaN2Wxa6tAQ-ciI7r4MnONzK5xdrBPtSM8-8mQSn5ZfjXiRi12HFZfy1T8-J0CyQUnDWuWIE4p0CPxPrW6oesOnjsFEdA_0KCqAvpz_E4U6jEedy8Sp_wlqBTdCqesz2CygMdNs3jkFTCrEKk9Yuw)

A harpooned ship's pilot can use its action to make a contested Strength (Boost) check, ending the effect on a success.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/O9btHW2o5crBzbgRAqPs7-EPiyxhCZ4URxRsecVZkZtukuWiAMN4kn857Kg05VTmeZky0IJSxUoy1MnMekVRtI0qQ9slSJjAi6Pnd2DXNxWwlLSbK_e350qYr6IzTk0dKv6McmjB3pQnKvlS5OJ8eg)

When your ship moves, it can drag the harpooned ship with it, unless the ship is larger than your ship.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sl4rCuJJ0oKLPFS0SV29GBPTF6RUSOIrzW3-ciLQ5cCfOLo_b216snSctTFy506SlemZNO9vaqy5ZA0yefmAjTnAdhsgCbywEWXtfsqoLlM8u0uaPd13x9Rh-18uh8n9_oR6sGBKuQlEk6EYUD2XfQ)

While the ship is harpooned, up to six creatures of Medium size or smaller can move through the gap onto the harpooned ship each round.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IjPA2d9ooUAEmza7ENcUdhWpKda_AOPrO-mWnmh0udYbxI7H2BdrEk0wdRvVWNIryPwwfYEzEHHteAOnT4VekWfUZGRYfX-4sP8SINSacpCo3GWQtQg6-zCqgfLHv6QHwgYT_KcrrkfYTrPnTl4vjA)

Recovering and reinstalling the harpoon takes 1 minute.

BUZZ DROID CLOUD

### 2![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/buCkzsRLkOVQtOTyVhP01PD9j-k5TYU3oJAblmmmVJKKUWEA5-sjI90NzzvmlpJv0DSitqfniTsqJxeiZ2Qhr7_iepwC3z6y1Ix7QbFzRjmPhGcu0mtbmkPEQyQiZ8IR22nPUb3JdTSj5PcxjfmTdg)

As an action, a crew member may scatter a large number of Buzz Droids across space in a 200-foot radius sphere centered on a point within 1500 feet. These Buzz Droids tear apart the hull of any ship that encounters them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a ship moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage directly to the hull for every 50 feet it travels.

The Buzz Droids are nearly invisible in the darkness of space. Any creature or ship that can’t see the area at the time the area is created must make a Wisdom (Scan) check (DC 15) to notice the Buzz Droids before entering the area.

As an action, a crew member may cause a wave of cold energy to spread out from your ship. Each ship in a 150-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 2d6 cold damage and gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk II

As an action, a crew member may cause an explosion of cold energy to erupt from a point it chooses within 900 feet. Each ship in a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC

= 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a ship takes half as much damage and isn’t slowed.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk IV

As an action, a crew member may generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 600-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 2500 feet. Each ship in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's iwisdom modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 8d6

+ 20 cold damage and is stunned for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the ship takes half damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As an action, a crew member of a stunned ship can make a Strength check (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier), ending this effect on itself on a success.

A ship reduced to 0 hit points by this power explodes instantly, as its hull shatters into frozen chunks.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

COUNTERMEASURES

This modification adds a series of countermeasures to the ship, granting it a more active approach to ward off effects. Once per round, when your ship is forced to make a saving throw against an effect that would cause it to be blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, or stunned, a crew member can use their reaction to add the ship's Wisdom modifier to the roll (minimum of +1).

DAMAGE CONTROL SYSTEM

You install a damage control system on your ship. A crew member can take the Patch action as a bonus action. This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

ELECTRICAL DISCHARGERS

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I

As an action, a crew member may choose up to three ships that you can see within 300 feet to make Wisdom saving throws (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). The first time each turn a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw for up to a minute until the ability ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II

You choose one ship you can see within 1200 feet and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot’s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all ships it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it’s using.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk III

As an action, a crew member may scramble the targeting protocols of nearby ships. Each ship in a 300- foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot’s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies up to a minute, until the ability ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk IV

You emit an electromagnetic pulse, potentially shutting down all ships besides your own within 1200 feet.

Ships within range must succeed on a Wisdom (DC = 8

+ prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or become disabled up to a minute or until the power ends.

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

EMERGENCY GENERATOR

Your ship is equipped with an emergency generator to recharge shields. When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a crew member can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a crew member can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice the ship's strength modifier.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS 56  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)  

FEEDBACK SHIELD

Your ship's shield is enhanced to reflect damage to would-be attackers. As a reaction to the ship being hit with a primary or secondary weapon, a crew member can use their reaction to deal damage to the attacking ship. The damage depends on your ship's size: 1d4 for a Tiny ship, 1d6 for a Small ship, 1d8 for a Medium ship, 1d10 for a Large ship, 1d12 for a Huge ship, or 1d20 for a Gargantuan ship. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

FLARE PODS

Your ship is a equipped with a series of counter- measure flares. When your ship is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, a crew member can use their reaction to release a flare. When they do so, your ship has advantage on the triggering saving throw. The crew member can choose to use this feature after the roll is made, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If they already have advantage on the saving throw, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

HARDENED PROW

Your ship has been modified to to be more effective at ramming. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, and the target fails the saving throw, the damage dealt is increased by an amount equal to two of your ship's Hull Dice.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.

You install an interdiction drive on your ship, which can be activated to impede ships around it. As an action, a crew member can engage the interdiction drive. Each ship within 100 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew members's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship's flying speed is reduced by 100 feet and its turning speed is increased by 50 feet until the end of your ship's next turn.

If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

INVULNERABILITY DRIVE

Your ship is equipped with an experimental device which can render it immune to all damage. As an action, a crew member can activate the drive. Once activated, the drive lasts for 1d4 rounds, granting the following benefits:

Your ship is immune to all damage.

Your ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Your ship's turning speed is doubled.

A crew member can end this effect at any time, no action required. When the effect ends, the crew member must make a Destruction saving throw. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.

MINING LASER

Your ship is equipped with a laser used to extract ores and other minerals from objects such as asteroids.

Checks made while using the mining laser for determining outcomes of work (for example, using downtime rules from Wretched Hives) are made with advantage. If you already have advantage on the roll, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

Additionally, a crew member can activate the mining laser as an action in order to make a Strength (Boost) check against a ship that is touching you (for example, a ship that is ramming or being rammed by your ship, or one you are landed on) (DC = the ship's AC). On a success, the adjacent ship takes 1d8 + Strength modifier energy damage.

NANO-DROID DISTRIBUTOR

Your ship is equipped with a nano-droid distributor that allows it to repair other ships. When a crew member takes the Patch action, they can instead repair another ship within 100 feet. You spend and roll one of your ship's Hull Dice, and the target ship regains that many hull points.

POWER BACKUP

Your ship is equipped with a back up battery, which can give it renewed energy. When your ship is reduced to 0 hull points but not destroyed outright, a crew member can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 hull point instead. Alternatively, if the ship is making Destruction saving throws, a crew member can use their action to have the ship automatically succeed on a Destruction saving throw.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.

POWER HARPOON

As an action, a crew member may make a ship weapon attack with the power harpoon. The harpoon's range is 400/1600 ft. On a hit, the target is harpooned, connecting your ship to the target by a 1,600 foot cable.

At any time as a free action, if the connected objects are closer than 1600 feet, a crew member on your ship can choose whether the cable is slack or taught. When the cable is taught, any movement by one object away from the other, tows the other object. When the cable is taught, movement by the first object away from the other object is considered movement through difficult terrain if the first object is within one size category of the other object. An object two or more size categories smaller than the other object cannot move away from the other object when the cable is taught.

If the objects are 1600 feet apart, the cable is always taught.

While connected by the cable, a crew member can use a bonus action to reel, pulling your ship towards the target (if larger than your ship), or the target to- wards your ship (if the same size or smaller than your ship) by 200 feet. At any time, a crew member on your ship can release the cable (no action required).

As an action, a crew member of a harpooned ship can attempt to remove the harpoon. To do so, the ship must succeed on a Strength (boost) check contested by your Strength (boost) or Dexterity (maneuver) check.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

SELF-DESTRUCT MECHANISM

Your ship is equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that can cause immense destruction at the expense of the ship. A crew member can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing thermite damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hull Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll.

The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:

Your ship's reactor is overhauled to give temporary boosts to your ship's weapon batteries. When your ship hits another ship with a primary or secondary weapon attack while it still has shield points, a crew member can use their reaction to cause some of the damage to bleed through. The damage the ship's shields take is reduced by an amount equal to your ship's Strength modifier. The ship's hull then takes this much damage. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

Choose a Small or smaller ship you can see. The target must make an Intelligence (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) saving throw. On a failed save, it is disabled until the start of your next turn.

Each time the ship takes damage or is the target of a hostile power or ability while disabled in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk II

As an action, a crew member can dictate a one-word command to a ship you can see within 600 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or follow the command on its next turn. If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot’s Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the ability ends.

Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Deactivate. The target becomes disabled and then ends its turn.

Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses

are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk IV

As an action, a crew member can choose one ship you can see within 600 feet and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot’s Intelligence modifier. If you or ships that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the ship is charmed by you for the duration.

While the ship is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are within the same system. Via your ship, you can use this link to issue commands to the ship while you are conscious (using a bonus action), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that ship,” “Move over there,” or “Fly casual.” If the ship completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the ship takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the ship to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. For every action, bonus action, or reaction you make the ship use, you must spend an equivalent action.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Boarding Harpoon

Your ship's harpoon has been modified, allowing it to conduct bursts of energy into the harpooned ship. A harpooned ship has disadvantage on the contested Strength (Boost) check to remove the harpoon.

Additionally, as an action on each of their turns, a crew member can deal pulse damage to a harpooned ship. The damage is equal to one of your ship's Shield Dice + your ship's Strength modifier.

Finally, when your ship makes a Strength (Ram) check, it can reroll one of the dice.

SLAM

### 2![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mntj57X3P0PiAM8DeJrrsZ-PCggv2Ua3r7BfSyzPjE5HvnVz2QSm710JLJnL0kCHTWa97WAmZ-nQKjoMZ4O963lZjyh0vh1-4qGrgfP2xMW9RCyLpOJnv_ktCWJRT1N-6BKCYVcJZhcuNDxybK0_-Q)

Your ship gains a SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM). As an action, a pilot can activate the SLAM to gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 600 feet on its turn if you SLAM. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 300 feet this turn if you SLAM.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

TIBANA GAS PROJECTOR, MK I

As an action, a crew member can dump a load of tibana gas in a 100-foot cube within 600 feet. For the duration, it is difficult terrain.

When the gas appears, each ship in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier) or become ionized. A ship that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.

The gas is flammable. Any 50 foot square of the gas exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each ship that enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

As an action, a crew member can shoot a thin sheet of flames from the ship. Each ship in a 150-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier). A ship takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Stealth Device

This system improves the stealth mode function on your ship. While active, your ship no longer has disadvantage on Intelligence (Probe) and Wisdom (Scan) checks that rely on scanners, and no longer has to roll on the Hyperspace Mishaps table before entering hyperspace while stealth mode is active.

Additionally, your ship is expertly equipped for Dexterity (Hide) checks. If it is already expertly equipped, it instead gains a bonus equal to half the ship's tier (rounded up).

ASTROMECH SOCKET

This system adds space for an astromech crew member and allows a single deployed astromech crew member to take the Boost Engines, Boost Shields, and Boost Weapons action as a bonus action on their turn.

### Comms Package, Premium

This modification improves the native communications on your ship. Crew members can now communicate in real time with any planets, space stations, and starships in the same territory as you as long as they are similarly equipped.

Additionally, when your ship sends out communications, those communications can be encrypted, only understandable by recipients with the cipher. A crew member can encrypt communications by making an Intelligence (Slicer Tools) check, setting the decrypt DC. Another crew member can spend 1 minute attempting to decode the encrypted communications by making an Intelligence check against the decrypt DC. On a success, they decrypt the message. On a failure, they do not decrypt your encrypted message, and can't attempt to do so again for one day.

Lastly, your ship is expertly equipped for Charisma (Broadcast) checks.

ELECTRONIC BAFFLE

When your ship would become ionized, shocked, or stunned, a crew member can use their reaction to roll one hull die and suffer damage to the hull equal to the amount rolled in order to ignore the triggering condition.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

EMP DEVICE

This modification adds a reusable EMP device to disable nearby electronics. As an action, a crew member can activate the device. Each ship, within 100 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. You ship automatically fails the initial saving throw, but has advantage on subsequent saving throws against this effect.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

FLIGHT COMPUTER

This modification implements a secondary transponder code into your ship's sublight engines. This transponder code can differ from your primary transponder code in terms of ship's owner, designation, make and model, any registered modifications, and the ship's ownership history.

A crew member can switch the ship's transponder code as an action. A creature can determine this transponder code is a fake by making an Intelligence (Technology) check (DC = 8 + your ship's bonus to Charisma (Swindle) checks). On a success, they determine that your transponder code is a fake.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Charisma (Swindle) checks. If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped.

SENSOR DAMPENER

This modification adds a remote sensor dampener to your ship. As an action, a crew member can attempt to dampen the sensors of a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8

+ your Charisma (Interfere) bonus. On a failed save, the ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member on the affected ship can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Dexterity (Hide) checks. If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped.

SHIELD DISRUPTOR

This modification adds a shield disruptor to a ship, which is used to interfere with another ship's shield. As an action, a crew member can activate the shield disruptor and choose a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. You make a Charisma (Interfere) check contested by the target's Constitution (Regulate) check. On a failed save, the ship's shield capacity and shield regeneration rate are reduced by half for 1 minute. If the ship's current shield points would exceed the new shield capacity, they are reduced accordingly. At the start of each of the target ship's turns, a crew member can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is targeted by a larger ship, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If targeted by a smaller ship, it instead has advantage.

You can end the shield disruptor at any time (no action required).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

This modification adds a stealth device to your ship. This device effectively counteracts or negates the use of scanners, both for and against your ship. A crew member can activate or deactivate a stealth mode as an action. While active, your ship has advantage on Dexterty (Hide) checks that rely on scanners, but your ship has disadvantage on Intelligence (Probe) and Wisdom (Scan) checks that rely on scanners.

Additionally, if you try to enter hyperspace while the cloaking device is active, you must roll on the Hyperspace Mishaps table on page 76.

A crew member can fire the super-heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/I7Su79G2_tOQUhMO-Xtl1QZoY58E8CrGaj8K5Ka-SxA8knIipPPIW8UoIRxel73eSZImQOY7-uPbSCFjyd3RpMAUllQ3Q40dNFO3uUzTeTx3TgiVabDHrHmqi3leIolYFMtm11-3CY8eK1JP3zzR9w)

If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw. If targeted by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

Each ship within the firing arc must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is tractored. As a bonus action, a player can move a tractored ship 100 feet in any direction. As an action, a pilot of a tractored ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

The saving throws are made with advantage if the target is larger than you, and with disadvantage if smaller.

If you are attempting to tractor a ship larger than you, fail or success, you can choose to gain the tractored condition and move yourself instead.

You can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

This suite adds escape pods to your ship. Each escape pod comes equipped with a Class 15 hyperdrive, emergency rations and supplies that can support four civilians, crew members, or troopers for 1 week, in both hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The quantity of escape pods is equal to one-fourth the ship's suite capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table.

  

EQUIPMENT ROOM

This suite adds an equipment room, adding 4 modification slots to your base modification capacity.

  

EXTERNAL DOCKING SYSTEM

Your ship is equipped with an airlock and couplers designed to attach and connect to one or more ships of a size category smaller as described below. As an action, a crew member can engage or disengage the external docking system. While a ship is coupled to your ship, the ships can share primary systems as appropriate, and creatures can transfer between ships readily. While an external docking system is occupied by at least one ship, your ship’s flying speed decreases by 50 feet (to a minimum of 50 feet), its turning speed increases by 50 feet, and its hyperdrive is considered one class greater (to a maximum of Class 20) for determining travel time in hyperspace.

Alternatively, this suite can accommodate multiple ships of smaller size. A Huge ship takes up the space of 10 Large ships, which in turn takes up the place of 10 Medium ships. One Medium ship takes up the space of five Small ships, which in turn takes up the space of two Tiny ships. You can also replace a ship with a droid or construct of four size categories larger.

  

FUEL STORAGE

This large fuel tank is able to store additional fuel portions in your starship. The tank stores fuel units equal to 5 times your ship's normal fuel capacity. These units can be used to fuel your own starship, or they can be transfered to other ships.

Fuel can be transferred to ships of other size. A Gargantuan fuel unit takes up the space of 10 Huge units, which in turn takes up the space of 10 Large units, which takes the space of 10 Medium units. One Medium ship takes up the space of two Small units, which in turn takes up the space of two Tiny units.

  

HIDDEN STORAGE

You install a remote override that can allow your ship to be controlled from afar, provided the controller has access to a console and transmitter to control the ship from. If proper credentials are not supplied, a successful Intelligence (Slicer Kit) check (DC = 10 + the ship's Tier + the ship's Intelligence Modifier) is required to control the ship. If the ship is currently controlled by another party, the check is made with disadvantage.

Your ship’s maximum and minimum crew requirement become 1: the remote controller. Your starship cannot benefit from features that would increase or decrease its crew capacity. The controller instead controls all aspects of the ship, as if they were deployed inside of it.

The starship has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while being remote controlled.

This ship can be controlled remotely from a distance of 10,000 feet.

Lastly, if an effect would suppress communications for the ship, it cannot be controlled remotely for the duration of that suppression.

The Broadside Hardpoint is a modification to two Fixed Hardpoints that grants an additional limited firing arc to each hardpoint, as described in chapter 9. The hardpoints must share at least 1 limited firing arc, and the two firing arcs of a hardpoint need not be adjacent. This modification installs a dedicated gunner station for each hardpoint. Attacks made utilizing the additional limited firing arc can only be made by a crew member deployed at the dedicated gunner station of the weapon.

DIRECT CONTROLLER

This hardpoint also installs a dedicated gunner station at or about the hardpoint.

Attacks made utilizing the unlimited firing arc can only be made by a crew member deployed at the dedicated gunner station of the weapon.

A weapon slave array is attached to a hardpoint and used to fire the weapon from the cockpit or other crew station rather than from a dedicated gunner station at the hardpoint. A crew member deployed remote from a dedicated gunner station can now fire this weapon and utilize the additional limited or unlimited arc at disadvantage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/olJmJgyWJI2HSPoqO3r1RjtUS3-nFXKIzWJ34e7oMoTvWv7vArFDhpE0ONqtfPo-y0ciDJJcV9U2FSfrmaL55KTJeqk0JtmIGvjWKofjch8-ZCLw_rCAVgr6eiGXCZB0UD8lu_Q-Mk9cGfUG_Rxapw)

peddle their parts. Santhe engineers preach the benefits of their lightweight ship armors, while Czerka employees counter that reinforcement trumps speed. SoroSuub representatives propagate the destructive power of their heavy laser cannon across from BlasTech vendors demonstrating their rapid-fire laser cannon, which they tout as more consistent. Across this planet, and many others, ships and parts for myriad vessels are available for purchase.

This chapter offers choices of certain equipment types, to be used in conjunction with the starship upgrades featured in Chapter 4. The listed prices are those appropriate to ships of a Small size; when outfitting a ship of any other size, you'll want to apply the starship size equipment cost, as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Cost table below, which differs slightly from a similar table found in Chapter 4.

COST MODIFIERS

It costs more to purchase a primary weapon and its ammunition for a capital ship than one for a starfighter; parts for bigger starships are simply costlier to acquire and install. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier, derived from its size as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Cost table below, which is multiplied by the base cost of the item.

For instance, to purchase and install Deflection Armor on a Small size ship, it costs 3,100 credits. To purchase and install it on a Huge ship, however, it costs 155,000 (3,100 x 50).

EQUIPMENT WORKFORCE

Additionally, bigger ships require more people to install new equipment. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additionally staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Equipment Workforce table below.

INSTALLATION TIME

With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter's equipment can be installed in no more than a week's time.

However, installing a new equipment layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/m6uJ0M3qAKKS-1kPIsYeqXcaA7rE55WdWp_zpopSenqs7e-YyWUI5ul1DlI0O6zflzmKzArVrUlwwPEsQsL96byc-FA_UuqLCTcq65yFTdc5pxzNLX8n3XgvrPR3mc2K_0ggMUGIJR9mNQxHcnrmew)

For instance, to install Deflection Armor in a Small ship, with a workforce of 1, would take 6.2 days. To install it on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, would take 3.1 days [(3,100 x 50) / (500 x 100)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

CARGO

One of the primary features of a starship is its ability to store and transport cargo. This capacity accounts for everything not directly mounted to the ship, such as consumables, extra fuel, and personnel.

CARGO CAPACITY

Each ship comes with a capacity for a certain amount of cargo, depending on its size, as shown below in the Starship Size Cargo Capacity table.

ARMOR AND SHIELDS

Different ships use different types of armor based on their size and maneuverability. Snubfighters typically use lighter weight armor giving them greater avoidance, while bombers focus more on absorption over maneuverability. In addition to armor, some ships have shields to give them a greater defensive advantage.

ARMOR

Armor augments the Armor Class and hull points of a ship. All starships have access to armor without need of modifications.

## ARMOR CLASS

The armor class of a ship is determined by taking the ship's base armor class (10, without any plating modifications), adding the ship's Dexterity modifier and any other applicable bonuses to it. For example, a Small ship has a base armor class of 10. If the ship has a Dexterity of 16 (+3 modifier), and the ship is using deflection armor, the ship has an armor class of 13.

## DEFLECTION ARMOR

Deflection armor is the most common type of armor aboard ships, and offers no benefit or penalty to armor class or hull points.

## LIGHTWEIGHT ARMOR

Lightweight armor offers a trade-off of a more maneuverable but less resilient ship. A ship with Lightweight Armor installed has a +1 bonus to armor class, but has one fewer maximum hull point per Hull Die.

## REINFORCED ARMOR

Opposite of lightweight armor is reinforced armor. This armor improves a ship's resilience, but makes it less likely to avoid damage. A ship with Reinforced Armor installed has a -1 penalty to armor class, but has one additional maximum hull point per Hull Die.

SHIELDS ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OUvkbRJ0grQikTB1Y86uzDL2YUeUWZ5l2St7mAsgnPbX9hHFADXw50aFZUqvhnRB_K7teWvSUPzlCdkKnlVhImK54T65i_UnzBRZ7yXe7ynnbjHbNSoFPztZHWD2H5yyba7_UHmzjSeYlbg6IF_3Lg)

are, while shield regeneration rate determines how quickly those shields regenerate. All starships have access to shields without need of modifications.

Your starship's base shield points is calculated like your's ship's maximum hull points. At Tier 0, your base shield points equal the highest roll of your first Shield Die, as well as the average roll for each additional Shield Die. You also add your ship's Strength modifier to each die.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1cohXHIWtBvubydVp3BN0r5dfTMgT-2kRjGo6i1Q46Izos7psWQUhYWTM5_RB0-8ApeMo6jFtaBH32iKfhUCQSviWyt587hLMxBn5CjSVKbqKotyBapOj4gDAHp_-qQ_eb0kWL8yjKgfUCxJNw4Hyw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/nEtDcyYBbcIvZ6QxLu1S8vXcSt1Q3Dac8sdX-7WqctzFwhOJiNOD6ezmvibrkkupFGH0dQtZ4iZOvGhTIDUSJ_88UwYmV7Y21ear4yKAngWXI1b_vMbia7e9UD8o1_oTCTbSiKeGaKUovfIXVOlfsw)

The capacity of shields is calculated by multiplying the base shield points by the shield capacity. For instance, if a ship has 50 base shield points, then it would have 50 shield points with directional shields, 75 with fortress shields, and only 33 with quick-charge shields.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SM5qcjx6XFpGd_YmbEnFzkeQ-06_4BkZumTcwAfruI9Gda6FyTgFTNvt4TW_eqa_iK32TbxNR-spOz8lQ62T-KNkg8taJGMGmBzXM4Xrgk9CJ04IenbR99ytBU5fBps2_4G1kkPDW4A5aCtfziohYA)

Shield regeneration rate is represented by a value. Your ship may regenerate shields (no action required) once per round on the ship's turn by that amount by expending a shield die, up to the Shield Capacity. The shield regeneration rate is calculated by multiplying the maximum value of the ship's Shield Die by the shield regeneration rate coefficient. For instance, a Small ship regenerates 6 shield points at the start of the ship's turn with directional shields, but only 4 shield points with fortress shields (6 x 2/3).![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OFdxpXXpYimGkdpoRD1SVcVts3UwmlM2h8ofg9fvT40HeyvxznjnxfQ-Dh1qtqCcW4ZZvukmie09UdvQ3XVDIyLyZGb2FJ5BOroO92BY-pKZNu_635QZyQ_qHZYfqoCEzbbIVkQb_2HCqhsZcgudYA)

In the event that shield points are reduced to 0, they can no longer be regenerated until your ship is refitted.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hvEj3KW_Jmw6iUFSSvptSdcpZZVVJ4yD8ZqolAQH14Zg6rbCMYaTYE40-Na7M6p5zZDrAASzBQeIqzJjU2RV_d1_V85rRhlqqU_Sm6nqHKI__jCe4IA37esl17Z4HSjKe2xNGW4fvs5BhVJx0nI_XQ)

Your Shield Dice are all replenished after a recharge.

## DIRECTIONAL SHIELD

Directional Shields are the most commonly used and balanced shields on the market.

## FORTRESS SHIELD

Fortress shields offer a higher maximum shield points, but regenerate slower than normal shields.

## QUICK-CHARGE SHIELD

SHIP POWER

Ships have different power generation, distribution, and storage systems based on their energy consumption needs.

POWER DICE

Deployed crew members can use a ship's power die to fuel special abilities granted by ranks in a particular role or by ship modifications. A power die is expended when a deployed crew member uses it.

The size of your ship’s power dice is determined by your ship’s tier, as shown below in the Starship Tier Power Die Size table.

Your ship’s maximum power dice, where they are allocated, and how many power dice it recovers each turn are determined by your ship’s reactor and power coupling.

## Starship Tier Power Die Size![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rUOMj1fvDLCsbvUgYiY6LW8pgzyHzVkUixbnQmIvHklP8xup3a-i5PFoTeye7BSq1CxdXkRrY26oDz0T-Z6vLEUmfg054iTR6yOL4zGAMf0InHMEEVqQA-E6aBxyLTPounZ5J42YKu2O3AVoIdzonQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8fM9pIR7hb5VLBo2SDP-sFnR0fEfsicJPEvHXWLKBKNTUDUgcazFhFxk5SYrbuKiszhNNQniRpfX7NglY6vDnRSzGS2tj-Zhn_O4c-IQa7YGTSmC7OcIIMe_oOhifmMsfG_PdBm3weFRS_0l3iVRyg)

  

REACTORS

Different ships use different reactor types based on their intended uses. While the majority of commercial ships use standard reactors with average performance characteristics, some ships use more specialized reactor systems. Ships meant for endurance or stealth often use reactors optimized for fuel efficiency and low energy waste, while military craft often use reactors with greater fuel consumption and improved power output.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KHXhxXATpvfEaUnYkVPtpcXqbonMonWw5koAcTsUBjstmIYzgG0CsX1i9CezEeWQaa3nv1XpNnJzeOCdwI2yInJ-1PvzTBTh00ImOV-W2w3xNU9LMqCj6cz7v6dEHXRCDrhn6b0jh9ctepTcmd9aDw)

At the start of each of your ship’s turns, it recovers a number of expended power dice, as shown in the Power Dice Recovery column of

the Reactors and Power Couplings table below.

## FUEL CELL REACTOR

Fuel cell reactors are the most common and balanced reactors on the market.

## IONIZATION REACTOR

Ionization reactors are highly fuel-efficient reactors that trade power output for fuel economy.

## POWER CORE REACTOR

Power core reactors have highly variable power output capabilities, but sacrifice fuel economy and as a result.

POWER COUPLING

Different types of power couplings are used in ships, often based on the number of crew expected to operate the ship. Three typical power coupling models are in standard usage: direct power coupling, distributed power coupling, and hub and spoke power coupling. These power dice are stored in a central and/or individual system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Vrc1CmGRG3cakwbAmliaD8tXjz9Jax6Zq8WRj4FhxhfHHAjk2X7WUKqOYrjD5jUB3MjTgBYOr2zoxWdDIzoaKpYnqWF3oheSFJT3KYNHVKMqpl9AX0OEk3JKIeeLoB7NiyTTe7RiFRniki44rbEKsw)

Your ship’s maximum power dice are determined by its storage, as shown in the two storage columns of the Reactors and Power Couplings table below. Dice stored centrally can be used by any system, while those stored in specific systems can only be used by that system. There are five systems: communications, engines, shields, sensors, and weapons.

## DIRECT POWER COUPLING

Direct power coupling has a central power capacitor that feeds power directly to each system.

## DISTRIBUTED POWER COUPLING

Distributed power coupling sacrifices flexibility by allocating power separately to each system.

## HUB & SPOKE POWER COUPLING

A hub and spoke coupling system combines attributes of both other systems, providing some flexibility and some increased power storage capacity.

WEAPONS

Ships have weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret hardpoint modification.

Ship weapons are divided into four categories: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary.

Properties vary based on the weapon's category.

PRIMARY WEAPONS

Primary weapons are the most common type that smaller ships carry: laser cannons. If a medium or smaller ship has any weapons, it has laser cannons. Laser cannons vary in effective range, rate of fire, damage, and damage type.

In a Huge or larger ship, primary weapons are deployed in arrays called point-defense systems. Rather than an attack roll, point-defense systems call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects which apply to all ships entering or beginning their turn in range of the point-defense system. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage. A ship can not have more than one of each type of point-defense weapon in any firing arc.

Range. The first number is the primary weapon's normal range in feet, and the second number indicates the primary weapon's long range. When attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_rn1ZOgbocu4aEzZARg4MgZG3jCguRB1wTXMvSZ5neTJsDcEtcm0iD8wR7unWZhGVPowYE8entXlPuYwiECB_gDwNjawHlnwdbJgr8U5ZV5_5Q9UxT_iaLRy7l21iVBgCqAoRloSDJnn3Tcq9Gq3rw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ouiPoKcJvEsQciYaD0WMH_eit71nrM5QyeEDBvj2-NEJi4HTZ1JVTgPmTXXxJGO1_KMxScVPpbuQAM5X2ewzuM_pfg04fSDC2ZQzcyxksQKWAOHxl5_EngEg_fuFIewUJE2J394iKZbaS4pHO3GgGQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6m9x-ZG7oz9kx_kDpg1bd86_nXPsbIOcUJJhmqQaQhMabA0-582bK7mCWrdivn27mqnTzpfmiZEmtLSady5BRDSCTvYibRwx0H0LtS1Nqkrhbglq-fS3LcdD7RygHSV55Lk-OIwU8uKGYilRsF5Sjw)

In a Huge or larger ship, when attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond normal range, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OJ04sp1CE3GZw0ofA-IfbBTGIQyMIBUX95jYyNlTnl4z610jteV3tV4GDz9SphNtW4wMcwVkHGlMIjr2-NBbPdNOm9AdfNcBLhhfBeNwmTMLTok9YKBuGA27ccY1jJ5ECJjtlAo5_EK_OHcHTKergQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/u1BT4LUVu5iLmzK906xXlUtd0pAJ8auwe_cHYL9xV-3LSVarx1zT6kQceRoMu7vTOC4byP05MI0XzrIV0lffRwOn_WmRcYxArqRyITR1PlU1nkJ2Smha_m6nS_ydSKJlNq0XEgtr7dKsyZo29a2HaQ)

SECONDARY WEAPONS

Secondary weapons are typically railguns or a small turbolaser on Large or smaller ships. On Huge and larger ships, secondary weapons are the most common type of weapon, and typically take the form of turbolaser batteries. These weapons deal more damage and have a longer range than primary weapons, but they are more cumbersome. They are a common addition to gunships.

In a Huge or larger ship, you have disadvantage to hit Large and Medium ships and cannot target Small or Tiny ships with secondary weapons.

Range. The first number is the secondary weapon's close range in feet, and the second number indicates the secondary weapon's normal range. When attacking a target within close range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you would already have disadvantage because a Huge or larger ship is firing at a Large or Medium ship, you roll the higher die a second time. When attacking a target beyond close range, but within normal range, you make the attack roll unaltered. You can't attack a target beyond the secondary weapon's normal range.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/69KN76fkga-rK97IF9BalHS-cl0Yu3xW1950BLeqpeE3ZYXjFtNCoAf2LL2avA5fnetx2M0bT_NCEcEe2qR0LEfcNZ_OUfX8G1NBElbW0Mqm0t0qS0V3L8nERa8IFGdha7-K84WvMRXYRmbfIDyakw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ioBjQngAMEvjGaSLexUMJ6GHsDzAKvMdEjtoTxcsSeVB00a9SEcqnAqSrDgmS_f8X8Pnap5EESYHPwwNuKs3PvSlzQzQhtp_xZkZoLmCFcRLG_OXAgqAi8OC4L5i1kVcTsSv3Rh3aCd5x6Gqs9brmA)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/T77VuyDS8jQP4lTArMP26lFawNt6VHExjS0sF10senpQ2w0snI4eFKe-K5stwndfQh73immRWLL7zurHI0Bq-kn-Du27KnC9pFQwHYiBPBpgaa_VJnk9raVFmKOh30NRK1pUVSIuf3q5by0EVYGyBg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IR44Tvlar71Acz_8dYAXknymd_ubHEkltcFyx2zhqvt--t_mvnjLqBFiAUV4IXj1LbntCkT7J2xDG7tK_aTXzJR5ZDebD5ZY9K7oc0SWxBe4Ss883rDcNRZxfkpW69ID4F-y2ex05RJPczVtGO7ATQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1BUj_B3c20UlY5oLLG2BxlTSXOdnuFiN0ngD2MiVEQKUOn2dMjDZE0ZVxuQ_Gx8-Z4XHcfwvEEr7wGWrCK_S6IeNJVsvMniHeMkOAIxX_Exu4bLZQxejPHH-tLseDn9TWO_6w5MEhceHQZ9MxmGFNQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OJ04sp1CE3GZw0ofA-IfbBTGIQyMIBUX95jYyNlTnl4z610jteV3tV4GDz9SphNtW4wMcwVkHGlMIjr2-NBbPdNOm9AdfNcBLhhfBeNwmTMLTok9YKBuGA27ccY1jJ5ECJjtlAo5_EK_OHcHTKergQ)

TERTIARY WEAPONS

Tertiary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of missiles, rockets or torpedoes. These weapons often have a long range, high accuracy, and massive damage potential but they are limited use and expensive to obtain. X-Wings are typically outfitted with proton torpedoes, for example.

Rather than attack rolls, tertiary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage. On a die result of "1" the weapon scores a critical hit.

Ships two or more sizes smaller than you have advantage on the saving throw. Ships two or more sizes large than you have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Range. The first number is the tertiary weapon's normal range in feet, and the second number indicates the tertiary weapon's long range. When attacking a target with a tertiary weapon beyond normal range, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the tertiary weapon's long range.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Zav4u_4xtQ9xO_AqxfiHovLGkuJfwx_JytAXab_0rj2dkSFWfRO31nAec1c-6ujmSYWFkgkql6BgC13BoPtNjNrJ37T-EjrudGVIA1uXGHUWPdCwvXB9zGtaVYup7VTX_ioiRWDk0bKAAx4K6jEsDw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uzTFB1IkRJpvx-vyHKBUduob6bGaborRbNw1XUNpFHDTkzsgGaX0VJP-N3qVwQaSCYDsnMn6GP5TOjDRREf8hvPZmA-b42za3dhkos0HJ5B7kcoMk8FGVk1wJqI76L8nnBLVUVsW1Xmsjfacvq0yiw)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1V-U9mOd3q9NoamWuqE6FVNTlT6CO-7QI6Jz0AzxvQqeLOhnKI_2vdU0-gL3Ivo_OTG320xq2y-xqJgn0iQxTxzCzz_0FXqXj-vjVR5u2FpYTDdJfeNsAYNzUM0FLsfmI1FKlayllB3Hg41lb1d73g)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KZKrz7TL520kcdGOMlGuHTIf4zVCEli8JJrL4eG_h-fWKruFvq7VFREo5bcitIhsLmuC1Xhde9ANHgnH1mmtaofJ8VIdcb2RzvXDFyl_cN914St1T8eoe5WaX-3bUOcmrStdsARE6zUB5Lb4ncDruw)

QUATERNARY WEAPONS

Quaternary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of bombs, charges, and mines. These weapons deal massive damage, but travel at slow speeds, and costly to maintain. Y-Wings are typically outfitted with proton bombs.

Rather than attack rolls, quaternary weapons call for saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

When released, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving at the start of the firing gunner's turn. Quaternary weapons detonate when they physically connect with an object, when the firing gunner detonates them remotely using their reaction, or 1 minute after they are deployed.

When a deployed crew member takes the Attack action with a quaternary weapon, they can release multiple loaded ammunition simultaneously. If they choose to do so, the ammunition travels in the same space at the same velocity and can be detonated as a part of the same reaction.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/k_gpZtzw6Y00OiRc9cWhvich6wg0BQB7cp6LaSlPacfEuvFV_mjIMLb6wjZPxW021qI07NL7OFK2H_C2rqVELGrsSj4uKHKzaokXiUMWuUNop5SN73n-p2YoUo494FFLInhyWWFG_aTrKpgNHyK8Vw)

Quaternary weapons do not have a range.

Instead, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round.

WEAPON PROPERTIES

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

## AMMUNITION

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition.

Weapons with the ammunition property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range property varies based on the weapon type.

## AUTO

Automatic weapons only fire in burst or rapid mode.

## BURST

A weapon that has the burst property can spray a 150- foot-cube area within range with shots. Each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged ship attacks). On a failure, the ship takes the weapon's normal damage. The ship takes no damage on a success. This produces an amount of heat or consumes an amount of ammunition as indicated by the burst number. If the ranged ship attack would have disadvantage, affected targets instead have advantage.

## CONSTITUTION

A weapon with this special property requires more hull structure to securely hold and use and more cooling capacity to safely operate. While firing it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Constitution requirement.

## DIRE

Before you make an attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain the same bonus to the damage roll.

## EXPLOSIVE

When a ship is dealt damage by a weapon with the explosive property, creatures inside are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. The DC for the check equals 10 or half the damage taken by the ship, whichever number is higher.

## HEAVY

When you hit with an attack roll with this weapon, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1). Heavy is incompatible with saturate.

## HIDDEN

You have advantage on Charisma (Swindle) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

## HOMING

A weapon with the homing property gives disadvantage on saving throws made within normal range. Targets are not granted advantage on their saving throws for being at long range.

  
  
  

83 CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

## IONIZING

On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action by a crew member on their turn, the ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on the saving throw.

## KEEN

When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

## MELT

You may choose to forgo your proficiency bonus to your attack roll or suffer a penalty to the saving throw DC of the weapon equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do so, on a hit, you may add your proficiency bonus to the damage result.

## OVERHEAT

A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the overheat property. A character must then cool the weapon using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice). A weapon will naturally cool over a period of ten minutes of non-use.

## PIERCING

Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to the next attack roll you make against the same target before the start of your next turn.

## POWER

You can use a weapon that has this property to make a ranged attack without the use of ammunition. The weapon draws directly from the ship's power source.

Weapons with the power property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range lists two numbers. The effect of these two numbers varies based on the weapon type.

## RANGE

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

## RAPID

A weapon that has the rapid property can unload on a single target. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged ship attacks). On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage, plus an additional amount equal to the weapon's damage dice. On a success, the target takes no damage. This produces an amount of heat or consumes an amount of ammunition as indicated by the rapid number. If the ranged ship attack would have disadvantage, the target instead has advantage.

## RELOAD

A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A crew member must then reload it. Reloading a weapon takes 1 minute per ammunition

## SATURATE

When making an attack with a weapon with saturate, you use your choice of your Strength or Wisdom modifier for the attack roll. Saturate is incompatible with heavy.

## SPECIAL

A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

## VICIOUS

Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

## ZONE

Weapons with the zone property are activated with an action and persist until deactivated (no action required). The weapon creates a zone of difficult terrain within normal range, grants the ship advantage on dexterity saving throws against ammunition launched within the firing arc of the weapon and outside of normal range.

WEAPONS BY SIZE

In addition to the cost of the weapon varying by size, the damage dice and reload value for ammunition based weapons vary as well. There are two tables showing the various weapon systems that can be added to ships. The first is for size Tiny to Large ships, and the second is for size Huge to Gargantuan. A third table lists the types of tertiary ammunition that can be used by the tertiary weapon systems.

TERTIARY AND QUATERNARY WEAPONS

## SHIP WEAPONS (TINY-LARGE)

When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the reload number by half. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Medium ship, double the reload number. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Large Ship, quadruple the reload number.

For instance, a Rocket Pod Launcher for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 6; for a size Medium ship has a reload of 24. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 2; for a size Medium ship the Bomb Deployer has a reload of 8.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large is shown in the "Damage" column of the Tertiary Ammunition table. The number in parentheses is only used for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan.

## SHIP WEAPONS (HUGE & GARGANTUAN)

When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Gargantuan ship, double the reload number.

For instance, an Assault Rocket Pod Launcher for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 48. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 16.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan is shown in parentheses in the "Damage" column of the Tertiary Ammunition table. The number outside the parentheses is only used for ships size Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NQygzNj2NWen5jdQl8fMHczjr1NEP9vgWOUTvuXQwGIIjPMRbA289r8IXKt_WeEphdKZ56QzLEa6k64tNzBQzpeXV0mamZQN4LLk5KadZWXC53vHur5GjRoHe8b-fvCOMIscN56cPIg7limS0i0Qog)

AMMUNITION

Tertiary and quaternary weapons require ammunition. Values in brackets apply to Huge and larger ships.

Tertiary Ammunition. The ammunition for tertiary weapons varies based on the specific type of launcher attached to the hardpoint.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Oeq4julWuUqmcuYojYryV0_5h4J0TsIcxsU72mBXB7qtdiAGbZnIqWcc6Fj2fD_rx1mfSHDg_OVwAWOR-reKPOQ43bd6xEsgCPXFU37vhlyLBdM5WvBxSNfaM2D-2B0-r5yclzjyL0LYH28F9x2-1Q)

Quaternary Ammunition. The ammunition for quaternary weapons, while fire-able by the same bomb deployer, vary greatly in function. Regardless of their function, all quaternary ammunition has 1 hull point and an AC of 20. Upon destruction, all quaternary ammunition detonates. The damage value is appropriate for Small ships, while the value in parentheses is appropriate for Huge ships. For other ship sizes, scale the cost and die by reducing or increasing it, as explained in "Weapons by Size".![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NtdVSSKMJFMxmdnaqlHnytEL5sJsMD9MuJgI3lkov-6RimgJr6W14xzsmpC-AjNeL8924TND7dHV8KiBPsJKvNPVfRMBqlAidJcTJMdzwtd3KiTAkL4bKW3fxF2cuTp2EZndjKlXW0D6VnRFZLGXmA)

AMMUNITION DESCRIPTIONS

## BOMBLETS

When a bomblet detonates, each ship within 50 [100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## CONNER NET

On a failed saving throw for a missile or upon detonation for a mine, a conner net deploys on the target, which must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

## DISCORD MISSILE

On a failed saving throw, the missile deploys pistoeka sabotage or "buzz" droids on the target. At the end of each of the target ship's turns, the target ship gains one level of system damage. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship attempt their choice of a dexterity or constitution saving throw (DC 15), ending the effect on a success.

## EMP BOMB

When an EMP bomb detonates, each ship within 150

[300] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

## FLECHETTE TORPEDO

A Flechette torpedo detonates at a point within range, creating a 200 (400) foot cube of difficult terrain. Any ship entering or starting their turn in this area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 1d8 [2d8] kinetic damage.

## GLOP BOMB

When a glop bomb detonates, each ship within 50

[100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

  

## GRAVITY BOMB

Rather than exploding on contact, gravity bombs detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity bomb detonates, it attaches itself to the closest ship hull within 50 [100] feet, creating a mass shadow centered on the ship with a radius of 50 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. A ship can attempt to dislodge the gravity bomb at the beginning of each ship turn by making a Strength saving throw (DC 15).

Any Large or smaller [Gargantuan or smaller] ships with an attached gravity bomb are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

## GRAVITY MINE

Rather than exploding on contact, gravity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity mine detonates, it creates a mass shadow centered on the point of detonation with a radius of 50 [100] feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any ships touching this mass shadow are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

## PROTON BOMB

When a proton bomb detonates, each ship within 100

[200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 4d10 [8d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## PROXIMITY MINE

Rather than exploding on contact, proximity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a proximity mine detonates, each ship within 100 [200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## PULSE BOMB

When a pulse bomb detonates, each ship within 200

[400] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] ion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

## SEISMIC CHARGE

When a seismic charge detonates, each ship within 150

[300] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## S-THREAD TRACER

On a failed saving throw, the missile latches an S- thread tracer onto the target. When making an Intelligence (Probe) check to detect the S-threaded ship's hyperspace travel, its angle of departure can be detected on a roll of 15 instead of 25.

HYPERDRIVE

The hyperdrive is a propulsion system that allows a starship to reach hyperspeed and traverse the void between stars in the alternate dimension of hyperspace. For a starship to have a hyperdrive, it must have a vacant hyperdrive slot modification.

The hyperdrive functions by sending hypermatter particles to hurl a ship into hyperspace while preserv- ing the vessel's mass/energy profile, and requires a functional hyperdrive motivator to do so. The vessel then travels along a programmed course until it drops back into normal space-realspace-at its destination.

A crew member can engage the hyperdrive as an action, after which it takes 1 minute to boot up. During that time, if the ship takes hull damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher). On a failed save, the hyperdrive fails to boot. If the ship takes damage from multiple sources, it makes a separate saving throw for each source of damage. At the end of the duration, the pilot must spend at least 50 feet of your flying speed to move forward and engage the hyperdrive, otherwise the hyperdrive resets and must be re-engaged.

A hyperdrive's only function is to keep a vessel in hyperspace, and should a hyperdrive be forcibly deactivated or destroyed during transit, the ship will be violently pulled back into realspace.

Tiny ships never have a hyperdrive, while Small ships occasionally do. Medium and larger ships typically have a hyperdrive.

The speed of a hyperdrive is rated on an inverse scale: the faster the hyperdrive, the lower the rating or "Class". Acting as a multiplier for a given base travel time then, a Class 2 hyperdrive takes twice the base time to travel a given route, while the Millennium Falcon's Class 0.5 takes only half the base time.

A ship can have multiple hyperdrives. Larger ships typically have a back-up in case of failure. Only one hyperdrive can be activated at a time. Your ship must have a hyperdrive slot for each hyperdrive.

NAVCOMPUTER

The navcomputer is a specialized computer designed to calculate hyperspace routes. For a starship to have a navcomputer, it must have a vacant navcomputer slot modification.

When a crew member astrogates with a navcomputer, they can make an Intelligence (astrogation) check rather than making an Intelligence (technology) check at disadvantage. Further, they can astrogate as a bonus action rather than as an action.

All starships require refueling and restocking, as well as a place to dock where they can get these services.

DOCKING FEES

Docking fees vary planet-to-planet, but typically average around 20 credits per day in an average spaceport for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the Starship Size Equipment Cost table.

For Large and larger ships, docking on planet is impractical. Typically, most civilized planets will have docking station in space that the characters can dock to. Alternatively, if they don't need to refuel or restock, they can simply remain in orbit and bypass any docking fees, while the party themselves transfer to the planet's surface in a smaller transport.

## LONG TERM STORAGE

Long-term storage is available in some locations, averaging around 200 credits per month for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the Starship Size Equipment Cost table.

Again, it is impractical for a Large or larger ship to to be stored on planet. At large shipyards, long term storage might be available.

It generally requires about eight hours to get a ship out of long-term storage and ready for flight.

REFUELING AND RESTOCKING

All ships require fuel to operate; without it, a ship is effectively disabled. In general, most starships refuel each time they put into port, and during refueling other essential ship consumables (such as water and oxygen) are restocked as well.

REFUELING

Ships consume fuel in terms of "units", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship. A ship uses a unit's worth of fuel for one day of flight in realspace or hyperspace, after one hour of flight in atmosphere, or in a single jump to hyperspeed.

## PRIMARY SYSTEMS

When a ship refuels, their primary systems, such as electricity and life support, are also replenished. As long the starship has fuel remaining, primary systems function.

RESTOCKING

Ships store food and beverage in terms of "portions", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship.

Each living creature aboard a ship consumes one portion per day spent aboard the ship. A portion costs 10 credits.

he combination of your character's personal features, as well as their chosen deployment,![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tA-fWRSpN85_TpByhDerhzKNU-UUeKIPF3zW_M6keZ8qT6I5_1D4wMqYB-O-2Uay-FkOzeZmV-ayVLu9Gwlk8nE7EMCUnHGZ_TYxFm-_TFku0_1p1CJQOCf3MqTltFNVFUYBNJDmUuIR9MP1DDEnRA)

defines your character's capabilities in the space

component of the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other

character. Even within your class, species, and

deployment specialization you have options to fine- tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two sets of rules for customizing your character: multispeccing and ventures.

Multispeccing lets you combine deployments together, and ventures are special options you can choose as you gain ranks.

Ships are locked to their respective size-driven tiers and have no multiclass parallels.

MULTISPECIALIZING

Multispecializing allows you to gain ranks in multiple deployment specializations. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those deployments to realize a character

concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard specialization options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a rank in a new specialization whenever you advance in rank, instead of gaining a rank in your current specialization. Your ranks in all your deployments are added together to determine your character rank. For example, if you have two ranks in pilot and one in gunner, you're a 3rd- rank character.

As you advance in ranks, you might primarily remain a member of your original deployment with just a single rank in another specialization, or you might

change course entirely, never looking back at the deployment you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth specialization.

Compared to a single-specialized character of the same rank, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for

||MULTISPECIALIZING EXAMPLE<br><br>Drew is playing a 1st-rank pilot. When his character is ready to progress to 2nd rank, Drew decides that his character will multispec instead of continuing to<br><br>progress as a pilot. Drew's character has been<br><br>spending a lot of time with Rickey's gunner, and has even been doing some simulations. Drew decides that his character will multispec into the gunner<br><br>deployment, and thus his character becomes a 1st- rank pilot and 1st-rank gunner (written as pilot 1/gunner 1).<br><br>When Drew's character is ready to progress to 3rd rank, he can decide whether to add another pilot rank (becoming a pilot 2/gunner 1), another gunner rank<br><br>(becoming a pilot 1/gunner 2), or a rank in a third<br><br>deployment, perhaps dabbling in the inner workings of the ship (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 1/mechanic 1).||

PREREQUISITES

Unlike classes, there are no requirements for

multispeccing. When a player has progressed to a rank higher than 1, they can choose to multispec or focus on their primary deployment specialization, with no

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Ships do not have a proficiency bonus. When a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the

proficiency bonus of the appropriate crew member as long as the crew member has at least one deployment

  
  
  
  
  
  

your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

## EXPERTISE

If you have expertise in a skill as well as a feature that lets you forgo your proficiency bonus, you can only forgo your proficiency bonus once. For instance, if you are a 5th-level, 4th-rank pilot with an 18 in Intelligence and expertise in Piloting, you add 10 to your Piloting

checks (4 + 2 x 3). If you use the 4th-rank pilot feature "That's a Good Trick" to forgo your proficiency bonus, you instead add 7 for the Piloting check as a part of that Evade action (4 + 2 x 3 - 3).

VENTURES

Ventures represent talents beyond the deployment specialization of a character. This embodies their training and experience in other aspects of their lives. At certain deployment ranks, your deployment gives you the Venture feature. You can take each venture only once, unless the venture's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a venture to take that venture. If you ever lose a venture's prerequisite, you can't use that venture again until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the

Spacecasting venture requires you to be able to cast force or tech powers. If your character loses the ability to do so, you can't benefit from the Spacecasting venture until you regain the ability to cast force or tech

define these qualities--a ship's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.

ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS

Each of a ship's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a ship's modification, in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal average, but many ships are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a ship usually reaches. Some can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and capital ships can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to

+10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Sometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you make a roll with advantage or disadvantage, only the d20 is rolled twice. Any additional dice, such as the d4 granted by the guidance force power, are only rolled once.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi's Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers.

Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

97 CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES  

ADVANTAGE ON OTHER ROLLS

Though less common, advantage and disadvantage can occur on other types of rolls as well. When you have advantage or disadvantage on a roll, as with a d20, you roll the dice twice, using the higher of the two results with advantage, and using the lower of the two results if you have disadvantage. If a roll has multiple dice, you roll the dice together and treat the results separately.

For instance, the Boost Weapons action potentially grants advantage on a ship damage roll once per turn. If any additional dice would be added to the damage roll, those additional dice are only rolled once.

PROFICIENTLY EQUIPPED

Ships can be proficiently equipped for particular tasks, allowing her crew to add their proficiency bonus to the roll or save, as long as the crew member has at least one deployment rank. Enemy ships also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency equipped bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you are not proficiently equipped in the Data skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (Data) checks.

In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

EXPERTLY EQUIPPED

Certain features, such as Active Camouflage or a Boarding Harpoon, let your ship double its proficiency bonus with a given skill or modification, granting your ship the status of expertly equipped in that skill or modification. As usual, you can only gain expertly equipped status in a skill or modification once.

ABILITY CHECKS

An ability check represents a ship's ability to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a ship, or a crew member, attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the ship, or crew member, overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the ship or crew member makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

When making an ability check that involves your ship's abilities, you use the ship's score instead of your own, as dictated by logic.

CONTESTS

Sometimes one ship's or crew member's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to pass through a narrow gap simultaneously. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a ship's gravity projector tries to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That ship or crew member either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two ships tie in a contest to pass through a narrow gap, neither ship makes it. In a contest between a ship's gravity generator trying to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace, a tie means that the second ship fails to jump.

CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES 98  

PASSIVE CHECKS

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as probing meteors over and over, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden ship.

Here's how to determine a ship's total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the ship has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

For example. if a 1st-tier ship has a Wisdom of 15 and is proficiently equipped in Scan, it has a passive Wisdom (Scan) score of 13.

USING EACH ABILITY

Every task that a ship or character might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

STRENGTH

Strength measures the power of a ship's reactor.

## STRENGTH CHECKS

Your GM may call for Strength checks when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as trying to push through a malleable obstruction like a Conner net.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pkOlFlocPuOUeoL1907y1eBlcbG0P8ezxuig-bjjztNHfLiv3_B_bW-oeryqhIwAvfFkFl0p0ltbx92_3UB7NSf18sTpnny4ecukl1j2-Huv3sVbBg24Re4EskunnRw1a7TGV15IhwobHYowS2EzRQ)

Use the Ram skill when you want to slam into another object to deal damage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EtYi0Izpu5962bwEaFDrZmU6-eUWzpXDnokWhrIVfbNRJiAnc-_a_sPOku-J6s-jvGy_BiaxKResAWZY4X1VJAJz9SjQX6oocQ_qRofxDkhi2SJ7e471p3MhLji6YSzcz35IuofKk7EDyKeq_2fKRw)

Use the Boost skill when you attempt to push your ship to or beyond its limits. A successful Boost check can break ties in straight-line speed contests or to determine how fast your ship can accelerate to top speed. You also make boost checks in response to taking the boost engines, boost shields, and boost weapons actions.

## STRENGTH SAVING THROWS

Certain features, such as a Tractor Beam, call for a Strength saving throw. When you make a Strength saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Strength modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped for the saving throw, you also add the ship's proficiently equipped bonus to the result of the roll.

## DAMAGE ROLLS

You add your ship's Strength modifier to ship weapon damage rolls.

## FLYING SPEED

Your ship's flying speed is determined by a relationship between it's Strength and Constitution modifiers and its base flying speed of 300 feet.

To calculate a ship's flying speed in feet, use the following formula:

For instance, a ship with a Strength and Constitution modifier of +0 has a flying speed of 300 feet. A ship with a Strength modifier of +4 and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, has a flying speed of 350 feet [300 + 50 x (4 - 3)]. Unless another feature or condition says otherwise, a ship's flying speed has a minimum of 50.

## WEAPON HARDPOINTS

A ship can have a maximum number of hardpoints active equal to its Strength modifier times it's ship hardpoint size modifier shown in the Ship Hardpoint Size modifier table below. Active hardpoints can be switched during refitting with other installed hardpoints.

Ship Hardpoint Size Modifier

  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ship Size|Size Modifier||Ship Size|Size Modifier|
|Tiny|1||Large|4|
|Small|2||Huge|2|
|Medium|3||Gargantuan|3|

  

DEXTERITY

Dexterity measures the nimbleness of a ship, as determined by its thrusters and pilot.

## DEXTERITY CHECKS

Your GM may call for Dexterity checks when you undertake actions not covered by skills.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AnXSGNvdYTnSlOm_g6X-vkcOm9FIdth1DRw_WjzrpcMKJs6zIvbhI1QYNwn7qM4sTo62tbO4JuZnArxZXGklJ2ZIt14OT6Npb1mdq3rk1z5p0vvczJ2m3_JxwhAkPUV8qm0NBFv0aJu9CQyfK3Rmyw)

The Hide skill allows the ship to remain undetected by sensors from other ships and stations. Use the Hide skill when you want to approach a ship or station along a known blind spot, or slink through a debris field, or hide amongst asteroids.

The Hide skill is generally contested by a passive Wisdom (Scan) score if the ship's presence is unknown, a Wisdom (Scan) check if the presence is suspected or known but the general location is unknown, and an Intelligence (Probe) check if the approximate location of a ship is known or suspected.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a2028W9ww_3fI7lDeDXDFIVlAYUwIQ9dxukPtLpC-oMtgQnDJnPGJRkDf3ebn46fatrHY5FuYGRC7ke6_qLi1uu7SyDdMTWXrd8LvL5SItdD2dUjvDPX7i0HblQbFG_-g1NTjMGmuDJGCYjLM4eiUg)

Use the Maneuvering skill to perform tricky maneuvers in combat, to deftly fly through an asteroid field, and to impress others with flying skills.

Your ship is considered proficiently equipped in this skill if the assigned pilot is proficient in Piloting.

Your ship is considered expertly equipped in this skill if the assigned pilot has expertise in Piloting.

## DEXTERITY SAVING THROWS

Certain features, such as burst weapons, call for a Dexterity saving throw. When you make a Dexterity saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Dexterity modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped for the saving throw, you also add the ship's

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Your ship's turning speed is determined by a relationship between it's Dexterity and Constitution modifiers and its base turning speed, as shown below in the Starship Size Base Turning Speed table below.

## STARSHIP SIZE BASE TURNING SPEED![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SVfNCAEA-ZMBd7jmCMzP5UH-w8cKixCfCu6NliaJbC4hl1bqFCAChn0ou9enZuK1J7N6B6BytEydgWu8ytZzOV6_1rHisXuUwLg25PJz18nzgvtrMX6rGDHuBwP3ACI6le0fSI_dtlAkRWli59XnlQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7yKo_gKuD2PqBKpzjjOyBMHemKAudBpDWXio64cbeB1cLOwf3Y-8KwEkuw_qNRw2bDXi9bDSeY7kEHfg-nFSC5WsksaQO55ZaFa_DBXBHe4DG75lq260xNG8wyngzw8m7SOEHEwv-ZWy_JXDxqpc4A)

|---|---|
|Tiny|300 ft.|
|Small|250 ft.|
|Medium|200 ft.|
|Large|150 ft.|
|Huge|100 ft.|
|Gargantuan|50 ft.|

  

To calculate a ship's turning speed, use the following formula:

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Z4UQkVTPN7AcLgEVsgzONbxgGmE1nPXxRhrcgUSyip7GB_AehNPIj30JHS-R0xgkVhKffOnRUsZXVYyDjM4oo9SplbQoVIX9imVoDpwYSr-AGbfcvU9dNmuqTg9sxTvdkhTnbXYnyOlzlYVdn5bvQQ)

For instance, a Small ship with a Dexterity modifier of

+4 and a Constitution modifier of +0 has a turning speed of 50 feet [250 - 50 x (4 - 0)]. A Huge ship with a Dexterity modifier of +0 and a Constitution modifier of

+4, however, has a turning speed of 300 feet [100 - 50 x (0 - 4)]. Unless another feature or condition says otherwise, a ship's turning speed has a minimum of 50.

CONSTITUTION

Constitution represents the durability of a ship's hull.

## CONSTITUTION CHECKS

Your GM may call for a Constitution check when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as overcoming the debilitating nature of an ion storm.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/cNTBbNOjQ0cTNk03TdzoBwE5Fng_Yl3I80-XmU1cscoBRoZxxaxtEDLLnqyToXTcctvtA9JFu0t7eAXsH3jJlrypi1A4XHlmaOHxASgXxYD5Z3ooEtTQNFx8PE3PmuhNJynBnwQbFvWnx-ACrgg6tQ)

You can attempt to have the ship patch up damage it has taken, using one of its Hull Dice. When you take the Patch action, you make a Constitution (Patch) check (DC = 10 or half the ship's missing hull points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you have disadvantage on the Hull Dice roll. On a success you roll the Hull Die normally. When you would make a Constitution (Patch) check, you may instead make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check at disadvantage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MIhKF9Vu44LUCx1XK0J7a7ECHeAqOsjtyyVfSlz7_Viw83HgRd-_KYWCynj-0V1bFaOZz0Zl0XXI4N2-2msgR3ZH6-d5ZyRKGoFCZqoHGNBrtnwodYaR7A9rs1snbWe1JvD0Y5IgKwlINLb3Yjqqmg)

Your GM may require a Regulation check when your ship is pushed beyond its natural limits. Situations which might call for a Regulation check include:

Trying to reach safety on low fuel

In response to a mechanic straining the reactor Attempting to run at top speed for long periods of time Keeping life support running when out of fuel.

When you would make a Constitution (Regulation) check, you may instead make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check at disadvantage.

## CONSTITUTION SAVING THROWS

Certain features, such as a Heavy Ion Cannon, call for a Constitution saving throw. When you make a Constitution saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Constitution modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiently equipped bonus to the result of the roll.

## HULL POINTS

Your ship's Constitution modifier contributes to its hull points. Typically, your ship adds its Constitution modifier to each Hull Die it rolls for its hull points.

If your ship's Constitution modifier changes, its hull point maximum changes as well, as though it had the new modifier from tier 0. For instance, if your Small ship's Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2 when it reaches 1st tier, you adjust its hull point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hull points for tier 0, and then roll your hull points for tier 1 using your new modifier.

Additionally, if changes to assigned crew members or if some effect lowers your ship's Constitution score so as to reduce its Constitution modifier by 1, its hull point maximum is reduced as well.

## SUITES

A ship's maximum number of suites is based on its size and Constitution modifier.

If the ship has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.<br><br>For example, if a 1st-tier ship has a Wisdom of 15 and is proficiently equipped for Scan, it has a passive Wisdom (Scan) of 14.||

INTELLIGENCE

Intelligence represents the capability of the ship's computers and affects its targeting, discrimination, calculation, and memory functions.

## INTELLIGENCE CHECKS

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on the ship's ability to process large amounts of data and sensory input, to access esoteric data, calculate complex mathematical problems or to deal with computer slicing. The Astrogation, Data, and Probe skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MSTiaN8UnM8vBUmOYI5_SlDtLCjCeGo3ManOQBfXsdCtgLDfQ7IX208n7R4BWwrdZhWnPfqAAdWdakgJaGG7La8HV832bIayNsx1C9qMsW9JfHFvhRBgdoBJ3tzfQHPPCl4BHtq3kyjPrE0TG8DG_g)

Make an Astrogation check to calculate hyperspace jumps. For more details on making Astrogation checks, see the "Travel in Hyperspace" section of Chapter 8. When you would make an Intelligence (Astrogation) check, you may instead make an Intelligence (Technology) check at disadvantage using your own Intelligence modifier.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mdbh_9pXqB4FIaYXyPfegmRhq2DtQKXUtsYdPrIr6UaCM4jfxMbwWvfio88nxsNElsF7orhhedzZ6KxBtLinLAvnB1V2eWQlJxW4tpZytwOji8VpCisHOUsuizKteTABDyQ4QI-nz-4GJkxJSAv2mA)

Use the Data skill when you want to access your ship's data banks to learn information about appropriate information. Ships often have standard information about hyperlanes, systems, planets, and other astronomical information. Ships can also be upgraded to include more detailed information or information on other subjects. The more obscure the information or the more off-topic, the higher the DC should be.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jZIqSx3vL22JjRQ3SkeRIEIGgldlxg3M0NbDpjWaFHuRnX7ONN0OMuHaSCpd_wLRgx4UzLCO_OaKn0kBGEzVObcAbwzae51dIGENKYqoemV6gH7YuWHvq6_GaaglOhWfME3rB1vuU3qfZm9CS-BB4Q)

When you focus your ship's sensor suite on an area or ship and investigate in detail, you make an Intelligence (Probe) check. A successful check may reveal the location of a hidden ship, may indicate the presence of physical damage in a construct or of minerals in an asteroid, or may provide technical details about a ship you have probed or the presence of lifeforms on board.

## INTELLIGENCE SAVING THROWS

Certain features, call for an Intelligence saving throw. When you make an Intelligence saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Intelligence modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiently equipped bonus to the result of the roll.

WISDOM

Wisdom represents the capability of the ship's sensors and its awareness of its surroundings.

## WISDOM CHECKS

A Wisdom check comes into play when you need to draw on the ship's ability to sense its surroundings, perceive threats, and filter electromagnetic fields. The Scan skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h2L71C7o6OTHq-SIvAJV4Ieq8Sjmj-EH_xnWnGTonMdaHVm0JR32h8ZBygL-dNTiNtGdPNE1oxkbQZiFztnmCHo5WhKC3gSmBJo8_3L_v0X9iaPBVaIb7yM-QORFbXdvEYiSXx_vp2vqEPp0Kh1qbQ)

Your Wisdom (Scan) check lets you notice and locate the presence of something near your ship. It measures your general awareness of the ship's surroundings and the keenness of your ship's detection algorithms.

When you would make a Wisdom (Scan) check, you may instead make a Wisdom (Perception) check at disadvantage.

## WISDOM SAVING THROWS

Certain features, call for a Wisdom saving throw. When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Wisdom modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiently equipped bonus to the result of the roll.

## ATTACK ROLLS

You add your ship's Wisdom modifier to ship weapon attack rolls.

CHARISMA

Charisma represents the prestige of the ship and the ships' ability to project electromagnetic fields for communication and interference.

## CHARISMA CHECKS

A Charisma check comes into play when you need to command and influence others characters and ships with your own ship. The Impress, Interfere, Menace, and Swindle skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

Impress The Impress skill is a general measurement of your ship's beauty and soundness. Whether or not your ship is impressively outfitted and well maintained, does it look impressively outfitted and well maintained? Does your on-board cantina look opulent?![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tRMsedO11YBxnSJ57xDrVREHlMhbVLJG9JbPBtf79ycu--imZCNpBCKQN-iOJZvpmxXRhYPyWSvzv9CdJr14LqQQmKxhQ4j4Ypf9msn-QcaX8jexpqAQ971GQ0YIw7couTJJ90VmU2cEDR9IZ_FeyA)

When you would make a Charisma (Impress) check, you may instead choose to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check at disadvantage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6X_WNmknvqXBTqKnIJCcARuSQPLrJlQdxAH8-FlDdJ66JjC2WayhjpezMkSzh-IkGG05qHEDoGs6933_DWc5mtrwiOp2W9zWDiT_MKyVwRlZhEdF1rrnXvgk-rQouJNHimwBCVDCfg-nMKQ57tmaKQ)

When you attempt to interfere with another ship or creature you use the Interfere skill. When you would make a Charisma (Interfere) check, you may instead choose to make an Intelligence (Slicer's Kit) check at disadvantage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/dI-BCPvccKAMWf5YTHVlx93RiLOulaNbwdaZ4kDbVsc2IdAFLyMr2mGIbsmKeOh94Alkkw5WS_mQJQzOlhE_71D6Ed-1pnUJ3sgGiLuorDV89-K21R17UIe64l8UiWbOt3ag_8Ftc0AhyDScv3BqpA)

When you attempt to influence someone through the threat of your ship's abilities, whether speed, firepower, or toughness, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Menace) check. Alternatively, you may make a Charisma (Intimidate) check at disadvantage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TcLl6Lbkrvzg7BzI1Fe4Ej1ryDBPnVFkh8tksQ8i-VdR8KcfrMjcyv-K0UOvmxOOoF6xtaQsjtC9EPow9y7AyabVsjKMbiagPm5BJBccP7Z3gMAsVZ8X0CM0_WvXO-IuIXOPvSmRiGVQ9rJf63Aw4Q)

Use the Swindle skill when you want to pass your ship off as something it's not. Examples of using the Swindle skill include:

passing off a heavily armed ship as a simple freighter concealing the presence of lifeforms on your ship concealing the presence of hidden cargo.

When you would make a Charisma (Swindle) check, you may instead choose to make a Charisma (Deception) check at disadvantage.

## CHARISMA SAVING THROWS

Certain features call for a Charisma saving throw. When you make a Charisma saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Charisma modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficiently equipped in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiently equipped bonus to the result of the roll.

yonder, are the things that Star Wars adventures are made of. Your character, with the aid of their ship, might explore wild space, undertake dangerous smuggling missions, or dispatch pirate ships. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of adventuring in space, from the mechanics of movement to the acquisition of the ship itself. The rules for repair are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your characters might pursue between adventures.

||The Bureau of Ships and Services<br><br>The Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS) is a long- standing, impartial, third-party galactic organization that manages all data related to the massive number of starships present in the galaxy. The BoSS has stood for thousands of years due to their ability to stay neutral in conflicts.<br><br>Information on a ship's ownership and its captains certifications are kept on file at the BoSS at all times.

As a result of this, smaller spaceports rarely update their registries more than once a year.<br><br>The security on BoSS computer systems is of the highest caliber money can buy, making it almost impossible to access without proper authorization codes.||
|COMMUNICATIONS|   |   |

Whether adventurers are exploring uncharted territories or a complicated relationship with a criminal organization, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:

  
  

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.

The GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

SHIP REGISTRATION

Pilots are required to register their starships with the Bureau of Ships and Services (or BoSS). Additionally, at registration, the pilot must acquire an Operating License at the cost of 1,000 credits. To be eligible for this license they must pass a written piloting test, which requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Piloting) check.

TRANSPONDER CODES

When ships are created, they are assigned a unique signal called a transponder code. Once registered with the BoSS, this signal can be used to identify that ship using the BoSS database. The transponder code can be used to identify a ship's owner, designation, make and model, as well as any registered modifications.

Additionally, a transponder code can be used to access the ship's ownership history.

The transponder code is built into the ship's sublight engines, making any attempt to remove or alter it incredibly difficult; failing an attempt could damage or destroy a ship's engines.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Starships are equipped with basic systems that allow for communication in realspace. Typically, starship communications systems are limited to contact ships and planets within the same system, although boosters and specialized radios can reach up to several light- years. Opening a channel to a willing recipient is simply a matter of pinging their ship. They will receive a notification and can respond, opening the lines of communication.

HOLONET

The Holonet is an instantaneous communication system that allows planets to stay in contact despite the vast distances between them. A HoloNet transceiver transmits and receives information through hyperspace, allowing information to travel millions of times faster than the speed of light. Hyperwave transceivers are embedded at strategic locations, constantly relaying information throughout the galaxy. This networks allows for instantaneous three- dimensional holographic communications at virtually any distance, making it one of the primary means of communication. Government agencies, such as the military, typically maintain their own encrypted circuits on the HoloNet. Some experienced slicers have been able to access these encrypted channels, though it required access to a government compound for the requisite codes.  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)

  

103 CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING  

METOSP (MESSAGE TO SPACERS)

Upon arrival in a star system, most starships immediately connect to a specialized frequency responsible for communicating with incoming and outbound ships, called Message to Spacers, or METOSP. The METOSP message typically conveys a repeated greeting with information about flight hazards (such as blockades, weather, debris, or collisions) and relevant local regulations or customs (such as embargoes, tariffs, or landing procedures). All METOSPs are broadcast in Galactic Basic, though some worlds also broadcast in their native language. A METOSP provides pilots with contact information for spaceport control as well as information on landing patterns and traffic lanes. Most METOSPs are brief, repeating messages that refer listeners to other channels for specific information.

PLANETARY INFORMATION CHANNELS

Most planets also provide incoming space traffic with basic computer communication channels. These channels connect the ship to planetary information networks that provide everything from communications directory assistance to tourism information and planetary maps. Planetary information channels allow use of the Technology skill to access information relevant to the planet, and it possible for a slicer to access other functions.

TIME

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to navigate an asteroid field, a minute to dock in a space port, and a good 10 minutes to clear customs.

While traveling in realspace, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach a pirate stronghold on the other side of the planet travel those 150 miles in just over an hour.

In hyerspace, however, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Tatooine to Kashyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.

MOVEMENT AND TRAVEL

There are two significant travel types: Realspace and Hyperspace.

TRAVEL IN REALSPACE

All starships have sublight engines that propel them through realspace, using them when taking off, landing, or flying within a gravity sphere. Coupled with an ion drive, ships are capable of incredible acceleration.

When traveling in realspace, the GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You fly around the planet, reaching the stronghold late in the evening."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how far, how fast, and how maneuverable your ship is in a short window of time. Starships come equipped with two speeds:![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2Vm9U6topQXrzJqV0nJOzMXpsZLGvyDpV6_5bA94JnLrYy6TJwp7icweOEmtojLvUkb6bXW5K1xmzMW7HpUvfc1_yb4sUoiQIZoRmiBDhR73PhQrPz960bMxbEeBa5H7PFuU-aY9kLdyutqHfeamag)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SWJ2U_ICHNtE-wqEPT1_DAMWE76zSDPGM4Bu47GAMWzTgLUoJunda858R1izaW3Rb9PcPNwMW6z1Z86GJey72HVlmYJgJzcPAqWdfkDyd85XvJTfUr7AcjCGa_AgGwislnnmMldXhfApJzOcPiO0ng)

## FLYING SPEED

Flying speed is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels, it expends one foot from its speed.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BLOdHLsZ55pYK2F8j8AskWy8RxPcwjCRgX6K3xdVOTXe2Z7VxurUdl_nqw-PXnSHiNDdKKiK86bODCtNMlZoovWrPtPtrFpO8sCyr5-KpksYsjQrPvYYLxfdRBgY8bDMcC3e9Hu4Unkp43zK_w4ZCQ)

## TURNING SPEED

Turning speed determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to turn 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your flying speed. The amount you must spend equals your turning speed. For instance, if your ship has a flying speed of 350 feet, and a turning speed of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your flying speed, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your flying speed, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wa5daGrPDXEiVkHWyZDxMqSIH4kCyB9O2_-TsXoFnyoNABgKF1s5WaZn7utvLQSiiWpMRWgMcJvxCM1Y-MruzyuM7LDg5gqCXzntO4PGVk5ztU57Q6br6pW0WHxNXI-aaFOJjST49Q83H9KtvawtQg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FsNVBwuRT9iyylvSeGCVJQYynrCs0TRPZS9LED-CWYUdzf_kleM4HmI_h28eQWGtEP966UXB5SHnBE51bLVvehI6MxdacGpj2LOcME67AMheb1I9xXObe-VLZiWEuAddLA5zmoVg52Uv3PVono9yMg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EHA_3tpOrW5_wdnuKn1qHcsyYCUL7md-yufq4_5iZ0Me0wdJo_sj3mRLFp78Xmr-BvYSKU-AIqAHHGfqVoDjie7KI0sctXjBDP0D0j_fnmqJG28_QSHMz6NK_Wob32dh3Lsgo-fSmnzBMOIIy3LnBg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b-Lz8FNCDNxeAZ3g9qttFqemhJTjQvdgBN9QQKn8rZoZVyGM5BVbrS0SdYN17WbJ99lrxQZesvKetFAgoJNCyUNXw9VWSjvoG72aZYr259xoxgiu2H6HX-MX98PhiB4l3WfV0oPIAbL5NuAhCcKa-w)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zcsEgK76X_fuTMPN419_a7Mdrn_XgrfvdpbJGPmyT7lkUCsPORhQQyT5mQNkCXm4Qm8PiQ2W5J0q7zjTiVqq5h3B_Z-Qrsp0I3sxJVoSqjJwGQ6Ysum-6GfQB1frlP2sxU-sP-lA8Y_NlwubnmyvXw)

A ship can turn more or less than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

If a ship's turning speed exceeds its flying speed, treat its turning speed as equal to its flying speed.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KhZJucCONiJY0hJMma9tNICt8Dq8TDJDhM6in35uCqNcngQcHzKZKamX4tzC_BlefMsMoDZIqxbpHLhwLQZbvifk32zGmKg9XTIh4jTyj0DIA2g4tU3BvikriCQoCuB2Y7HhO_kd8hfjGqOJQsftrA)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wUKI6bljbeDdg90FctfezECqP4eKoEyOccqg8BZBkomsiaj5WK24WvqB2bfyjtSDtRADaxItuNJUTUz-DbZ_Xz01oxQvMnjqWXG4gexLv81QICi47Lm1paAGj4d9CMnmPgU7MNdmFVuhkKTS4iRBrg)

## TRAVEL PACE

While traveling in realspace, a starship can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace. While traveling at a fast pace, your starship's flying speed is doubled, but your starship and its crew have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks. While traveling at a slow pace, your flying speed is halved, but you can travel stealthily. A fast pace makes a ship less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for more information).

You can use the following Sample Realspace Travel Times table to determine travel times in realspace for an average starship traveling at a normal pace.

## DIFFICULT TERRAIN

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume unobstructed terrain. But adventurers often face narrow canyons, tight formations, or other difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

## ACTIVITY WHILE TRAVELING

As adventurers travel on their starship, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

## DEPLOYMENT ORDER

While traveling, adventurers want to determine who is deployed where.

A deployment order makes it easier to determine which characters can spot hidden enemies or anomalies, and which ones are the closest to their station in case a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the cockpit, a gunner station, or a relevant suite. The closer they are to their preferred deployment, the less time they have to

## OTHER ACTIVITIES

Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the GM's permission.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4Rb8Qbyt_RVkJ2noLFIBsA1JslGywlxJIpN5d6AQ_tPLQXyp4AcVAlHZfU5r6dPo586QuhzATwW0Uq2TXDQ4eVCe_zu32vS3iIqd2Awmx87wVpmusFQTVk40gvjDwSkknsTtbwotNvE9uZ0UrNtBaA)

The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making an Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8kE6TEeHQdNnvpNHY-kboB56yWfvFwTajTk6ApBQPawA7AyaS7LqD1gBAC1vUKWVDWmmNR-PLXH7XwVwbxZPzLqYxDBu2-zdsDREBSobI4bpG427gueWdLefs1BglJB0zOUO7UMvPrQfmSNfDdcscQ)

The character can maintain a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

Track. A character can follow the tracks of another starship, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-V7S-9HH1UAui7h_ZNNhnwcXedMscZeja9M4QzIlsHPSYcXfJ8qtKFB2MIHSLrj0Z5zL98mUHVq-8RQGKABQwaSi6RIcWmN9MdANUSJHkp0Ml491UhJWhJPCqdNhfPHuCfBHpKTSw_gLxXAHygBvGA)  

  
  

  
  

While traveling at a slow pace, the starship can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other starships they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

## NOTICING THREATS

Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the starship notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by deployed characters. For example, as the characters are traveling through an asteroid field, the GM might decide that only those characters deployed in a rear-facing deployment have a chance to spot a stealthy starship following the group, while characters deployed elsewhere cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/M7q5wzB71eehZE1LhBMGvhO03GidCjWIRThsdymaq3yZ2OGPEcTCxf71n9IJpY1B-s70iMxTG5h4Jf58liyKk39IzOWDz2TyXpGYFx23QhAPlMEQ61hEzZrTQx0S1IlIIBw1Dmw9hdchKPMFqTpyEQ)

If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter another starship while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a dialogue, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/REkj31rC85ghkzKAJZSFwdaZVVLePEU3-PqpT6rJD1w2M3gC3ttnFwIe1SUfhmI8aX95T94TWSGgc4AP8Y_sJFFjLOUYQE_wvXS0LO6rDb6Ytg80cPFOLAMK7ynlOTbrUkaR3q21NIlhx9aonjR0ZA)

If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.

  
  

The fastest way to travel long distances in space is through hyperspace. When a starship engages its hyperdrive, it accelerates beyond the speed of light and enters hyperspace. A starship in hyperspace can't communicate with ships in realspace. It is effectively cut off from realspace while in hyperspace.

Large objects that generate significant gravity, such as planets and stars, produce what is known as a "mass shadow" that projects into hyperspace. Collision with a mass shadow can have catastrophic repercussions. Hyperdrives have built-in safeguards that prevent a ship from jumping to hyperspace while inside of a mass shadow, causing a ship to immediately revert to realspace if the mass shadow is detected.

Interdiction vessels use gravity well generators to keep ships from activating their hyperdrives. Some pirates have been known to drag asteroids into hyperspace lanes in order to drag prey out of hyperspace.

While traveling in hyperspace, a starship travels at a set speed as determined by the classification of the hyperdrive. A class 1 hyperdrive travels at hyperspeed, while a class 2 hyperdrive travels at half hyperspeed, and a class .5 hyperdrive travels at twice hyperspeed.

The galaxy at large is divided into territories, which are in turn subdivided into sectors. Traveling from one planet to another in the same sector takes less time than traveling from one planet to another in a different sector of the same territory. Consequently, traveling to a planet in a different territory takes even longer.

You can use the Base Hyperspace Travel Times table to determine travel times. These times assume a class 1 hyperdrive.

## DETECTING HYPERSPACE TRAVEL

When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. If the result of the check is over 25, the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.

## ASTROGATION

Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crew member can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crew member can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the Astrogation Results table.

|21-25 Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations.|
|26-29 Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations.|
|30+ Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations.|

  

Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

You may choose to take a -5 penalty to your Intelligence (Astrogation) before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour. You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.

Alternatively, you may gain a +5 bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.

The BoSS: In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, they BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FpvQig-iL6Ug5Nq4r2BpJF5-mQIfh1eD_wGPd7M0y9Ix8OCMjw3ZKyoMbmBuic5x8o5UaSWiVH13J3LNzUtPAaja5-9nvg5mNK-dF0mN7a-XoE5N2oTJXUCfXz01ZFnM7FSS4-mS4P5ZG9vYa614sw)

Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.

## HYPERSPACE HAZARDS

A jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below. For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty. If you make a jump without any calculations and roll a 20, your ship comes out of hyperspace unscathed, but in a completely unknown location.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FMV_erYyVS8M-uOUs0s5__jYVqkTR6d3QPV7Cg1FJUo23TL6QiXNVFpZBMM60kao1v7CPxGJKF3PIThNvCDodMTJeYTCCYwD4f3a9bn1-ebp9RaF_k5TE1nvkOK6gdxQ_bNF_NnRgb8ZyOYwN5peGg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/f3CIRLIj8UsLQbhWaq9joaDeFYOMh1t2E7ZvuEvlsJ0LK63YIHXbKKQrrMI3XIKpRENb64s_0OBk3LJxhAcYW8SAw-GAHyvRbQFaC9XEynzMf0a7DR3NwsjWsQbL2LlzXQ41XVhB04pcV35n9WMpHA)

LANDING GEAR

All ships, regardless of size, come with integrated landing gear, complete with magnetic clamps. A ship can use its landing gear to bind itself another ship of a larger size. The landing gear can be engaged remotely from the cockpit, or manually in the event of primary system failure.

MOVEMENT IN ZERO GRAVITY

In some circumstances, such as prolonged power failure, or movement in space outside of the ship, a character might find themselves moving in zero gravity.

While in zero gravity, creatures can move in any direction. Zero gravity is treated as difficult terrain.

If a character has a flying speed, whether granted by an item or as a special trait, they do not treat zero gravity as difficult terrain.

CREW CAPACITY

Ships have a minimum and maximum crew capacity determined by their size, modifications, and determined use. Most Small fighters, for instance, have a single crew member controlling all aspects of the ship. Medium ships, however, might have a crew of half a dozen, while larger ships have crews in the hundreds to hundreds of thousands. Regardless, ships have a minimum number of required crew members, as shown below on the Starship Size Minimum Crew table.

|---|---|
|Tiny|—|
|Small|1|
|Medium|1|
|Large|200|
|Huge|4,000|
|Gargantuan|80,000|

  

The number of crew members that actively participate in combat, however, is much smaller. For coordinators, mechanics, operators, and pilots, each ship should only have one actively deployed crew member at a time. On ships where multiple people fill these roles, the chiefest and most experienced among them should be considered the deployed crew member for that role.

For gunners, the maximum number is equal to the number of hardpoints the ship has.

DEPLOYED

When a character is manning a deployment, they are considered deployed. A character can man multiple deployments simultaneously, provided they can access the controls for each deployment. For instance,

in a Small ship, a single character can fulfill all five deployments simultaneously, since they can reach everything without moving. In a Medium ship, however, a single character can function as both pilot and operator, but probably can't reach the controls for the ship's weapons or the ship's engines to function as a gunner or mechanic. In Large and larger ships, most deployment stations are spread out so it's difficult for a deployed crew member to man more than one deployment.

While deployed in only one deployment, it is assumed you can have access to all features of that deployment.

THE ENVIRONMENT

Starship exploration involves delving into the potentially dangerous, uncharted territory. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers, and their ships, interact with the environment. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.

VISION AND LIGHT

The most fundamental tasks of starfaring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, and hitting an enemy ship in combat, to name just a few—rely heavily on a ship's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, dust clouds, or electrical storms, ships have disadvantage on Wisdom (Scan) checks.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/UHmXlqEvCr2563XDFgQ49nI8WnpH2-K1qNWIgrnZHxcT6AWIG7Wvio6PNDidb6JScu6oOC5MoBCAwTaSMer2jMvXRQHmrtA6GXq2YUoImJIlu8f3egqMJTnVnhgsHNcR0S71EaQWLgIRy-uKZxdLjQ)

A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque gases, or dense asteroids-blocks vision entirely. A ship in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAR9QNZkkiWY8v9eZC9WOHvyYpAITsXDPT1u1wPRLM2ryQnaBjeVH4G6UMcqPp_1v_h9DZXlMOFQO_8vw1dHxnuM868cv85-2jSdIqQoJJptYUdNTV6Ts0vBBU550nWNr_M7BSZ7SJfXG8cSehdrzg)

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

Bright light lets most ships see normally.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fFOaHUwpoLC6nuxgEZxmNNfAmjxUD4ZiJmkPIN68YeQUh2lIHapbsF9o_DIYQvWfwKlfEsxK_ROuP8TINeerZ-l3S-20cyGeKDR3I5PnrQkWQnXwLznkrY4yHcWl6NsORNmyNeegmuaKI38dEUNofA)

Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, and surrounding darkness.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/e4dfsgr4FUw3SF3-6wHYEjc2RjUiLiX9vH1Ls527nCTsxN0H9niI9couYyT-DpbhyVegGrau8iksZ4XehL2b50cjGcoqIA-9OI0nXj1ilrvlHSrrcw1RG1PprYTiUPk0QYMlbpUPDBn6k25BZxSwtg)

creates a heavily obscured area.

## BLINDSIGHT

Crew members on a starship equipped with an enhanced scanner (Scanner, Premium) can perceive their surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

## TRUESIGHT

More advanced scanners (Scanner, Renowned) offer truesight, allowing crew members to detect starships that are completely invisible. Truesight allows a starship's scanners to automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them.

RECHARGING AND REFITTING

Over time, wear and tear on a ship accrues, forcing adventurers to temporarily abandon their pursuits to recharge and refit their ships.

RECHARGING

As long as a ship has the requisite crew, they can conduct makeshift repairs and the systems of the ship can reset and recharge themselves without the ship having to dock. Recharging the ship requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Workforce table on page 55, and takes 1 hour.

If conducting repairs is interrupted for more than an hour, the workforce must begin recharging again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

Once recharging is completed, a deployed mechanic can attempt to spend one or more Hull Dice by making an Intelligence (Mechanic's kit) check. On a roll of 10 or less, you have disadvantage on the Hull Dice roll. On a roll of 11 to 20, you roll the Hull Die normally. On a roll of 21 or higher, you have advantage on the Hull Dice roll.

For each Hull Die spent in this way, the mechanic rolls the the die and adds the ship's Constitution modifier to it. The starship regains hull points equal to the total. The mechanic can decide to spend an additional Hull Die after each roll.

Additionally, all shield points and Shield Dice are restored at the end of the recharging period.

REFITTING

Refitting is a period of extended downtime that requires docking at a spaceport or shipyard. Refitting costs a number of credits proportionate to the number of hull dice missing. The amount is 100 credits per hull die multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22. Refitting requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table on page 22, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the Starship Size Refitting Time table below.

|Tiny 4 hours|
|Small 8 hours|

|Large 3 days|
|Huge 1 week|
|Gargantuan 1 month|

  

At the end of refitting, a ship regains all lost hull and shield points, expended Hull Dice and Shield Dice, and its system damage level is reduced by 1.

## REPAIRING THE "USED" CONDITION

If the ship was "used" at the start of refitting, the foremost mechanic can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check. On a success, the cost of refitting is increased, and the ship is no longer "used".

Repairing "used" costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hull points. The amount is 10 credits per hull point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22.

PRIMARY SYSTEM FAILURE

In some instances, primary systems can experience failure. When primary systems fail, an integrated emergency back up will activate. This back up can continue running the starship, provided there is adequate fuel, for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, primary systems fail, causing all electrical systems, including life support to fail.

Once a ship's primary systems, all functionality of the ship ceases to function. If the ship can be towed to a shipyard, it can still be repaired, however.

## REPAIRING PRIMARY SYSTEMS

If the ship's primary systems had failed at the start of refitting, they can be repaired during that refitting, increasing the cost but not the time.

Repairing primary systems costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hull points. The amount is 10 credits per hull point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/271FqCULA3h66haHunbcp0mszPqkpcVap7Ww3StlI3Eh3jAB_9qsiEBu3Us2jYBlyTKYE8kywuHUlZPxCDtKcHu-ukUf4qnbjEU6dhXSCsjnR4jg7Hprfy55Zx3hT-fEh1xeN3YkDtd83Dhy2M4lRw)

109 CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING  

CHAPTER 9: COMBAT

s the light freighter exits hyperspace, it finds itself in the middle of a snubfighter skirmish.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b-5YDO02yUwB2sm7BmD01O25tFvOGbBBjX6mSBsa9enuq8Sdr92SXKIKuR49_FpXXUv31_xtYyB_UTNoN9CZgI81tDi6z7hHcwaR5PYD5R1odOqzqdcfW7UM_Z740-c0ju4ViuFKy3cTjS4LOuoTvg)

Immediately, the pilot begins evasive maneuvers while hollering for help. One crewmember hops into the copilot seat while two more run to opposite sides of the craft to man the gun batteries. Three of the snubfighters -- now identified as TIE fighters -- turn towards this new opponent and open fire, but the blasts dissipiate ineffectually on the freighter's shields. The freighter's two gunners, now in place, open fire on the assaulting craft. One takes the blasts directly to the cockpit and explodes in a blaze, while the other is hit on a solar panel and spins off out of control into the distance. The third attempts to pass overhead, but the copilot takes a shot from the freighter's slaved railgun and destroys the fighter in a single stroke.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and their craft to engage in space combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or GM. The GM controls all the other ships and nonplayer characters involved in space combat, and each other player controls either their own ship or a function of your ship. "You" can also mean the character or ship you control.

THE ORDER OF COMBAT

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of cannon shots and ship maneuvers. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/w_4kcyd0684OKlJappcOB35OWCUYokRcN4guBokmHdLcWG3xT5Gnjf9wh03Kgi1O8fxIMjRDhBdB1EVuOufs9eBUozAKiP7P46X3AfKkOpXLBC5bnXG73SICBMKcQ_ec-BBJsXAz96mjDGKS5t40lQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Ia6cMVSM8iyW6IVBZcWoIGv0beVdB_RrvOlyRH-gj_QSvZ2snhjFhUE0TEgoK5nctqdCs-tXbD__GE4dYGsVTWHl21uOJaiJ46-ApgpbFec_p-JL1oylTNBUtbUrEojZKCmT_IASM9lQF9Q2JhlnTA)

SURPRISE

An assault carrier exits hyperspace and immediately begins firing on its prey. Fighters rapidly exit bays to support and protect the craft. Their opponents, caught unawares, are slow to respond and take significant damage before mounting their defense. In this situation, one side of the battle gained surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any ship that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

  

YOUR ROLE ON YOUR TURN

Your abilities depend on where you are deployed during space combat. In a snubfighter, you control all aspects of your craft: movement and maneuvering, weapons, operation, and engines. In a larger craft, however, only one player can take pilot actions.

The "Movement and Position" section later in this

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|chapter gives the rules for your move.|   |   |
||Combat Step By Step<br><br>1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.<br>    <br>2. Establish positions. The GM decides where all characters and ships are located.<br>    <br>3. Roll initiative. Every PC on a ship rolls initiative normally, and the lowest initiative on each ship sets the initiative for that ship. All PCs on a ship take their individual turns on their ship's turn in an order agreed upon by the crew for that ship turn. In case of disputes, the pilot has final say. The order of character turns on a ship's turn may change from round to round.<br>    <br>4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in ship initiative order.<br>    <br>5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.||
|ACTIONS|   |   |

You may take one action on your turn, and any particular action taken by a player with your ship can only be taken once per round. For example, although two different crew members could both cast the same force power or make an ability check with the Medicine skill, they could not both take the Patch action, described below. Only the assigned pilot can take pilot actions, but all other actions may be taken by anyone on the ship as logic dictates.

## BONUS ACTIONS

Various class or deployment features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, power, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

## OBJECT INTERACTION

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment at any time on your turn, even during your move or your action, as your object interaction.

  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT 110  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)  

  

If you want to interact with an additional object, you need to use your action or bonus action (your choice. Some enhanced items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

## OTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN

Lastly, your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

## REACTIONS

Certain features allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur any turn.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

MOVEMENT AND POSITION

In combat, ships are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, the assigned pilot can move the ship a distance up to its speed. The ship can use as much or as little of its speed as desired, following the rules here.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XOCHaEbINctnCdib04kPA98oB72W_9LkJm0Il5GiBDrjaf_iJPHVqvuUh6HrsXpkP4i_8Jd5VOdVlFIYdssHSbgJNdD9vpd0b2d9DTH7E_xE54NCHKR7IV1oKO6C6pd7PNe2x7DEYzmjSx9lKSz9Nw)

Starships come equipped with two speeds:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WpUbiDbRMVq3X9sXxpWgCCknu_k03Qm2hJVPXz41F7vgqGGhv5sBxmXPziP5A6KvZY_06qriIUGHnzHQ0dvU3h9YYDjISAmIchBgWToWRQQM8SrkFmNdrwsoV8imSQMB14m8-2HzYK3Al4nM4PYlcQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BmQj9e5vkCsOh_0VBNfHc5ytDhFZ8e_Qqgghmxh9cfAbge3C7bSLkZpWDiSGidXglfldre_BhJyE2Qp2Iq63VHO2sLuHtbgQY0iRCuJ-aDcgJGXy7JWKzOUFTFzIj8Myd5D609zENSCA7sSN8THFxA)

FLYING SPEED

Flying speed is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels, it expends one foot from its speed.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/U2xSSkg1CvBXHbybgpuzhRRKynd1yLs-Vuemce-np9CWFDxSuDHR_Puoh6zCDNhbXbnANAXIk-5uRZ6FM6NP5a1ARrGc7JoRelgnWhZcRc9CmAX04e7Qvh3wX8dI6O0JHVl1vXcXiPmzF1xc3H5UXg)

TURNING SPEED

Turning speed determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to turn 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your flying speed. The amount you must spend equals your turning speed. For instance, if your ship has a flying speed of 350 feet, and a turning speed of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your flying speed, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your flying speed, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7qg7QtMIZZW0MVO0Eqr3P4Hyr6wAmH6oZxT6CDPJDH8By2dhEtqoLCUDpRhuRg6jPQqvY1cerfzbK728MUhAj68c9oIcZcNi6JbkDYMlMHKMvmySRzogsz6wQyjj7NtjoK4dAtOPZkhStp5kf1cnhQ)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3QcbbGLeCzuIrCOad6bgm7XDXRq4DOazfyvm4HMafbQ8f6xV1JuMsYkdHeC_LD3EJ2zKomAM6gp1IqzBqaO8BekzJ9xmOJiATdXKTcqDkS-csNP_9Xmymuh4OW5ToMRx4AYYojSZdWb0CZk_8FCXEg)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Kz2a-B6DzpTy4H4m3lUSFy5J_r0p1FcCq8wlk5au4jtkMIaQo-u7VG_C6Z708fRODl9ya7n8IaGDtCZZwIpAPESMEXCfJPXEmozTlfaB4XzXd8i8zxh5ytjI_dm2OSPAobUuqpiq5e3MjnuG9fVD9g)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KcVkfC6iNdsCeudqa8DOlwNfJ5ZAd93Q7QLeXQBVHT3B7rrcHOi_cbgHTio4iGPg7buPTz0T26UQhUONGQ7nFywZwoHCqDVVWnLFsDvaJEvETosX-jSMrSV-jUhCBMtUkrmzKh8iVZ2Sa2JC66kSug)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FeqFJckfl3jBViXgIo_GT_MDTlImWgf8O2IjW1Smw18DwNtIzle4mhiOkuZvRPkQNDnp5Baes-OPmx9ZOh_CXAQcu5onvMPGJkhNDyrCz-Ih62iJBGH_JERztMukGhQa4p_3ePvremuYhfoZnDa1xA)

A ship can turn more or less than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

BREAKING UP YOUR MOVE

The pilot can break up your ship's movement on its turn, using some flying speed before and after various crew actions. For example, if your ship has a speed of 300 feet, it can move 100 feet, two players can take actions, and then it can move 200 feet.

For instance, a ship might move one square diagonally (50 feet), then three squares straight (150 feet), and then another square diagonally (100 feet) for a total movement of 300 feet. r ship has a speed of 300 feet, it can move 100 feet, two players can take actions, and then it can move 200 feet.||
|MOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS|   |   |

If you take an action that includes more than one ship attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a ship that can make two attacks and that has a speed of 300 feet could move 100 feet, make an attack, move 200 feet, and then attack again.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Combat rarely takes place in featureless terrain. Asteroid fields, mountain ranges, tight formations--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

The space of another ship, whether hostile or not, counts as difficult terrain.

MOVING AROUND OTHER SHIPS

You can move through a nonhostile ship's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile ship's space only if the ship is at least two sizes Larger or smaller than you. Remember that another ship's space is difficult terrain for your ship.

Whether a ship is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

111 CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT  

SHIP SIZE

Each ship takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a ship of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same categories.

## SIZE CATEGORIES![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8pCpezh9v6z-JSzY4MCvy1vl1sPDEOGPs0VkLBBlzi_CG69iLPS-MpUcLP5trfPw9GI0ISZixkNLpdp15-NMMClFByMu5r9l2Af6FEnCYMWaNuXLK-wD6iL5Xeo6SrIj5zLPnxKCNkG1f8_B6vqGEA)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yNCTaguGjNGy9mHYaDc0VHOjKb1uA9XbUFqesKUGQQ_q4Syiqs9RidnKAdalt4nLY3Dee_hxix-wgKE-1FoMKIIfRbjX0IP4vX-jNBLaAE1aCohrSCePhGRjko9Q0FUfGpoPirLpZ22vUPe67tqDNA)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

A ship's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium ship isn't 100 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide.

ACTIONS IN COMBAT

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class, specialization, or some other feature, or an action that you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

Actions possible by a given character in a given circumstance are determined by the GM as logic dictates. For example, a snub-fighter control system allows for all actions to be useable from the cockpit. In Large and larger ships, players typically control a crew that carries out their actions, and, therefore, need not worry about which precise equipment is right in front of them. In medium ships, things are most complicated. Only one player may normally take pilot actions: the player in the pilot seat. However, if disabled, a co-pilot may be able to immediately take over without switching stations. Additionally, many other ship stations may be general purpose, allowing any non-pilot actions to be taken at them, or may instead be special-purpose, dedicated stations for each deployment. In any case, be sure to discuss with the GM which normal actions can be taken from which stations.

Unless otherwise specified, each action can only be taken on a ship once on each of that ship's turns.

ATTACK RUN

When you move at least 150 feet towards a target, you may use your action to declare an Attack Run. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder you (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you end this movement with the target within the normal range of one of your ship weapons, you can use your bonus action to Fire at it. If you would fly through the target's space, you can instead use your bonus action to Ram it.

When you do so, you gain a bonus based on whether you choose to Fire or Ram the target.

Fire. You no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls with primary or secondary ship weapons. Alternatively, if you fire a tertiary or quarternary weapon, you deal additional damage of the same type equal to your distance traveled on this turn divided 50, up to your ship's Strength modifier (minimum of +1). This bonus damage can only affect one roll.

Ram. If you succeed on your contested check, you can choose to deal additional damage of the same type equal to your distance traveled on this turn divided 50, up to your ship's Strength modifier (minimum of +1).![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ktQge6XFYXIB1xKuRcM4T3-_-N79MLFhjSfpLDnOceRBKw-gIjfEA7JHzWa657QMgTIzYl6Rha7ZhuhyYj-JR8pK5YbgTChyw0e6bg4kbl5iz-Z98PxeWZHWD9E6OEjr4EgruwHySOrDfjpw4w0YLg)

Alternatively, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw in lieu of this damage (The DC equals 10 or half the damage you deal, whichever number is higher). On a failure, the ship is stunned until the end of its next turn.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Attack Run action.

BOOST ENGINES

You can attempt to boost your speed. When you take the Boost Engines action, you make a Strength (Boost) check. On a roll of 10 or less, nothing happens. On a roll of 11 to 20, your ship's speed increases by 50 until the end of the turn. On a roll of 21 or higher, the ship's speed instead increases by 100.

BOOST SHIELDS

You can attempt to boost your shields. When you take the Boost Shields action, you make a Strength (Boost) check DC and roll a Shield Die without expending it, gaining temporary shild points until the start of your ship's next turn. On a roll of 10 or less, you have disadvantage on the Shield Dice roll. On a roll of 11 to 20, you roll the Shield Die normally. On a roll of 21 or higher, you have advantage on the Shield Dice roll.

BOOST WEAPONS

You can attempt to boost your weapon output. When you take the Boost Weapons action, the next time this turn your ship deals damage, you make a DC 12 Strength (Boost) check. On a success, you have advantage on the damage roll.

On a roll of 10 or less, nothing happens. On a roll of 11 to 20, the next time your ship deals damage this turn, it has advantage on the damage roll. On a roll of 21 or higher, the ship's instead has advantage on the next two damage rolls it makes this turn.

CAST A POWER

As normal, you can cast force or tech powers. You cannot target a hostile creature with a power unless you are aware of their presence and location. The Cast a Power action can be taken multiple times on a ship's turn.

DIRECT

When you take the Direct action, one creature can see or hear you gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can direct a friendly creature that can hear you in attacking another target. If your ally attacks the target before the start of your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. The Direct action can be taken multiple times on a ship's turn.

DOGFIGHT

When you take the Dogfight action, you engage an enemy, ducking and weaving, vying for a good shot while avoiding theirs. You choose a target you can see and make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuver) check. On a success, you cause the next attack made against your ship by the target to suffer from disadvantage, but you grant the next attack made against your ship by a different target advantage. Additionally, you can perform a primary or tertiary weapon attack from a forward-facing limited firing arc against that ship without suffering the normal disadvantage.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Dogfight action.

EVADE

When you take the Evade action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against your ship has disadvantage if you can see the attacker on your instruments, and your ship makes Dexterity saving throws with advantage.

This action affects your entire ship: any skill check or attack roll made by your ship or anyone on it also has disadvantage until the end of your ship's next turn. The effects of Evade end if you are Incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Evade action.

FIRE

The most common action to take in combat is the Fire action. With this action, you can make an attack (or attacks) with one ship weapon you can reach. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks. The attack action may be taken multiple times on a ship's turn, but normally only once per weapon. A pilot taking the Fire action has disadvantage on attack rolls with primary and secondary weapons.

FLY

When you take the Fly action, you gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 600 feet on its turn if you Fly. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 300 feet this turn if you Fly.

This action affects your entire ship: any skill check or attack roll made by your ship or anyone on it also has disadvantage until the end of your ship's next turn.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Fly action.

HARASS

You can harass an enemy and lock them into a series of close-combat maneuvers in order to prevent their escape. When you take the Harass action, make a contested Dexterity (Maneuver) check against a target within one size category of you and within normal range of at least one of your forward-facing primary weapons. This weapon cannot be used for a Fire action this turn. On a success, if the target voluntarily leaves its square before the beginning of your next turn, it takes damage as though it suffered a critical hit with the primary weapon used to harass.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Harass action.

HIDE

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Hide) check in an attempt to hide your ship, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Hide action.

INTERFERE

You can attempt to interfere with another creature within 1,000 feet that is deployed on a ship, if you are aware of their presence and location, in the attempt of a task. When you take the Interfere action, you make a Charisma (Interfere) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Scan) check. If you succeed, the subject has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. The Interfere action can be taken multiple times on a ship's turn.

PATCH

You can attempt to have the ship patch up damage it has taken, using one of its Hull Dice. When you take the Patch action, you make a Constitution (Patch) check (DC = 10 or half the ship’s missing hull points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you have disadvantage on the Hull Dice roll. On a success you roll the Hull Die normally. When you would make a Constitution (Patch) check, you may instead make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check at disadvantage. The Patch action can be taken multiple times on a ship's turn.  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)

  
  
  

113 CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT  

  

RAM

You can attempt to ram another ship while flying through its space. When you take the Ram action, you make a Strength (Ram) check opposed by the target's Dexterity (Maneuvering) check. If you succeed, both you and the target ship take kinetic damage equal to two of your ship's Hull Dice + your ship's Strength modifier. If your ship has shield points remaining, your ship instead takes half this damage.

Only a deployed pilot can take the Ram action.

READY

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger. For instance, "When the enemy appears, I'll fire my railgun at it."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

REGENERATE SHIELDS

You can attempt to regenerate your shields faster, using one of its Shield Dice. When you take the Regenerate Shields action, you make a Strength (Boost) check (DC = 10 or half the ship's missing shield points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you roll the Shield Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a success you roll the Shield Die normally.

SEARCH

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Scan) check or an Intelligence (Probe) check.

USE AN OBJECT

When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. The Use an Object action can be taken multiple times on a ship's turn.

MAKING AN ATTACK

Whether you're shooting your laser cannons or a railgun, an attack has a simple structure.

1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack's range: a ship, an object, or a location.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_cKw0hY40m7xRDD_cPYWrWVP050tefPTdgSgx2we660SZoBM0BPN3U7MmVjcn6kn3vf-xUAUDigvHC3IcrutQQSQGmSKr4PdZdIgMhW33zqQRVsi7NSNIYzqkCm42--_QAJ3BGL2pPS6bHB1yLxufg)
    
2. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, powers, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ibQtAbYF0XyxFzK52hcUagpoPyinL68trymRHkVMybz5DwwB811bTFrZldzjPj26FHGfikTpdxOVvXrAaoy3Sj--n7i3g77qlmsNSvxlvr30MH2eARmDHqC4tipUnQPW9VoXv2VSAIm-CrzGFKmwKQ)
    
3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Y1gaOJDT2d50Zj_iGRKK3_98zlEfPNEKrZt0xPWThaUeY-FCGmoLKUCVvKDf-nnEv2JxKMuCuHkBywMp53Q918wv4wZ-WaEf8gHfAotAcIXkEnb3xNk6dBVCISd6kh3qIFfs3aKelp4FZmqbMDwthg)
    

ATTACK ROLLS

When you make an attack with a primary or secondary weapon, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20, add your proficiency bonus (if you have at least one deployment rank), the ship's Wisdom modifier, and any weapon-specific bonuses or penalties. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

Ships are always considered proficiently equipped with their properly-installed weapons.

## ROLLING 1 OR 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a gunner, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

## RANGE

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

Ship weaponry typically has two ranges. The value of these ranges depends on the type of weapon (primary, secondary, or tertiary), as described in Chapter 5.

## RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a ship weapon or a power, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 50 feet of your target.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT 114  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bhSMlQb-DYIsmENA_q1Jp4cPbCPtK9p2M6_rdLD-klSFq4NNR2i6XuAegm3xamPTjSWSF_AE2hDKBF3jfu7ss4xi7zH4aihJ0FhnDGZu6AUOVnRC4AaNDqatdEtE4VCiPlGPHb2YvTbR3jYD7fehbg)  

  

FIRING ARC

Ships have a firing arc, which is determined by the hardpoint on which they are mounted. Fixed hardpoints offer a limited firing arc, while turret hardpoints add an unlimited firing arc.

## LIMITED FIRING ARC

Many weapons, such as forward- or aft-mounted laser cannons, can only fire in a single direction, indicated by a limited firing arc. The available arcs are spaced 90 degrees from each other, are adjacent, and consist of: forward, aft, port, and starboard.

Weapons with a limited firing arc only fire at targets within a cone, with the weapon's fixed hardpoint as the cone's point of origin. The cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin.

## UNLIMITED FIRING ARC

Weapons with an unlimited firing arc can fire at any target within range and line of sight.

SAVING THROWS

While many weapons utilize an attack roll, tertiary and quaternary weapons, as well as primary and secondary weapons on Large and larger ships, instead call for a saving throw. When an ability grants advantage or disadvantage on an attack and the attack calls for a saving throw instead of an attack roll, unless otherwise stated, the saving throw is made with disadvantage or advantage, respectively. The saving throw is calculated as follows:

Weapon save DC = 8 + the gunner's proficiency bonus (if at least rank 1) + the ship's Wisdom modifier![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Kahxe37jyEZWSa1jjzlKoWJ947wDDKI3NBIlqKFzR4tWaw1IGwL9jRdepCQvSN-2x5-5T78Y8n8xd9ojKy76RI36g1LJZsFYBYq9150DLmSXHs0vwncufmQZe4RJwY3B3M-jDizBMyXMksIRKLBGnQ)

DAMAGE ROLLS

Each ship weapon specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add the ship's Strength modifier to damage from primary and secondary weapons, and apply the damage to your target. Higher quality weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

## CRITICAL HITS

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

## DAMAGE TYPES

Starship combat relies on four different damage types.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HGhIR30b-YjFh_iPylCQ0mM7rtHg1sv-ADEanIy3-jN-ZeQldCjn_6UMk8kjoJgK6_rehvYtEspwBBshPFeGqyjLMzclJ8DixmmtQHa6e9iSgzkCAwCggpQ4MvA_DraGiZLeNxsnpGIPfX_8VI0eLQ)

The most common type of damage, it deals normal damage to armor and shields.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wglGTuID9U1GRzKbP-Qu4veCNepE81JFd-pFVhzLxyPxWwgZKwimqGMZaoO5GfP8LqdhgjtKCFPyjJjW6jE8bmShSttcSNXcOzNlVOAuGGXuvPRTrYxE3sDFklLGkdICzWkiOapUgcfrs-vAj7C8YQ)

Deals normal damage to armor and shields.

Additionally, when ships collide with each other or debris, they deal kinetic damage.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HJ4_xNRtwjEMxwPzi1RDXXPWUE8F-MuVDSmb81vQlkIjsFYSXVMdoB7oqErrnlijG4PfcCGcHLYBTmlYGfmr9-6eKWKLhN2Ia74AfvkJRZQ1RdeUBd0rlFbWpoeKT79WiFUYqlQP9gnQgJFX4dJc5g)

Ion damage is less effective against armor, dealing only half damage to armor.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PBKrplCDjaOtrLw7fxt4P0xO1oYekoo0AD-roMo3d7HFREXRfgdNqEezjhb6v30xYyVhx_8aCb8LqN-0B9soYXQfVqiz3kFWUARDiXqrtQMUyHeef-mqlPp3ssKLpxWz6XMaBWjD6gQsic5KF_rong)

Fire damage is less effective against shields, dealing only half damage to shields.

DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY

Some ships might have resistance or vulnerability to a damage type. If a ship has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a ship has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after passive modifiers to damage, but before active modifiers.

COVER

Asteroids, ships, debris, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are four degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a ship that gives half cover and an asteroid that gives three- quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with one-quarter cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has one- quarter cover if an obstacle blocks at least one-fourth of it.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bA1X1o_pXP7xCkKfhqysdQDZ-uc-tU9R7fSCOcTPPkWocejq1mNprukgj5-btl-X48Zt-NyByJJOI5ny3aeG7kdEqltv6OzLzSlFQRIPyWILAghXyTX3RbIHt7n7G6WdGaVbjPAJDS4pSnq4vSzB8g)

A target with half cover has a +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of it.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/T9dDJEZJPLcW6KVCzPHcASEwEeDLeTqR-zKEpz88EKCIvYny-Oig6jbXlvoOYrJH55DUw9QjDlmXPbirr_wA-6j9aHV-SVXYl7VwlE0GlA6nui0lu7BH5MFAG_nihOWUz-Hde_ARy2nv9Y-vDq6MNQ)

A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three- quarter cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/I7BOfw5Uv0sMYbOaI6ZLtKffkyG1VMDsLCfinaJn7CI_sRNil-9WbcO9j3upIOkc1VyZmDfw49eBuSWbkcm3Hb-8RyY_YlIOsNFmPwHa4vFkpRSZQGFBY-bzC4h4eMjQQmz-IuuScK9h5yvovq9Vfg)

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a power, although some powers can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vyrVK4h6CvQcaUM_JhY-4I_9N2cOZTaE4vvgUtRVUAFlb2Z4e5G9c_tiZkmeAY93oJjr-pPrcIpQKPyDW3tVAQt6qkX3yWQzAp_dyJaOKF0XWXS-F6Dq3-s_raw7XLBClJK2eiMuNfqyFK3oyMw5LQ)

115 CHAPTER 9 | COMBAT  

DAMAGE AND REPAIRS

Space combat is lethal, and players always run a risk by engaging in it. A well placed cannon shot, a proton torpedo, or a seismic charge all have the potential to damage, or outright destroy, a ship.

HULL POINTS

Hull points represent a ship's hull integrity. A ship's current hull points (usually just called hull points) can be any number from the ship's hull point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a ship takes damage or receives repairs.

Whenever a ship takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hull points. The loss of hull points has no effect on a ship's capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hull points.

SHIELD POINTS

Often, a ship will have a buffer of energy called a shield. Ships equipped in such a way of shield points in addition to hit points.

Whenever a ship with shield points takes damage, the shield takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ship's shield points to 0, the hull takes any remaining damage. For instance, if your ship has 5 shield points and takes 7 damage, your ship loses its shield points and then take 2 damage to your ship's hull points.

REPAIRS

Damage to hulls is permanent until repaired. Small repairs can happen while the ship is still in space, but significant repairs require docking in an appropriate location, as discussed in Chapter 8.

When a ship receives repairs of any kind, hull points regained are added to its current hull points. A ship's hull points can't exceed its hull point maximum.

DROPPING TO 0 HULL POINTS

When a ship is reduced to 0 hull points, it is either destroyed or disabled. If the ship is not instantly destroyed, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Massive damage can destroy a ship instantly. When damage reduces a ship to 0 hull points and there is damage remaining, the ship explodes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hull point maximum.

  

## DESTRUCTION SAVING THROWS

At the start of the pilot's turn, if the ship has 0 hull points, you must make a special saving throw, called a destruction saving throw, to determine whether or not you're able to salvage your ship. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score; you are in the hands of fate now. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success has no effect by itself; on your third success, your ship becomes stable (see below). On a failure, your ship suffers 1 level of system damage. The successes don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three successes, or your ship's primary systems fail.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-fSbzQg0EF0-OEAOQ40uooJ0Kg1xIyMvNnvb-mqCmqdjoOMU_9ID586I26WAU7WI6QrXCDBzj4m88kwyr-kpTZunIFufkBnV3fAc6qV0SKxct4sW_DGNjcBtckzBkPoD7ELrFrVIFMuxHbxog5qicQ)

When you make a destruction saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures, causing 2 levels of system damage. If you roll a 20 on the d20, your ship regains 1 hull point.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zfD-0W-WOvpWgPJtvdYRR4yTqM_NbOIyZ2V9Zhk1V70NvQoOU6PWvHjeBoXoifgvkPYHnkpLR-zz8octg62JPBTlZyhXY7toKXsBwJUzsGWTTD7s6FvuKGSbk145WkHRFykXwrA53gBmCvXEgy-SyQ)

If your ship takes any damage while it has 0 hull points, it suffers 1 level of system damage. If the damage is from a critical hit, it suffers 2 levels of system damage instead. If the damage equals or exceeds its hull point maximum, it is instantly destroyed.

## STABILIZING A SHIP

The best way to stablize a ship with 0 hit points is to repair it. If repairs are unavailable, the ship can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed destruction saving throw.

A deployed mechanic can use their action to attempt repairs on a disabled ship and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check.

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hXmg1gM-u62XZCkuNr7Kjp4G5i8QR6L4IxS5WRcm45yqGSILQPW6TNeT1qnaV468SeMN1OGOerVJfYHC4D0G8SOzvHrXH71JX9ib1UPRJa54sdcDAoar7YpgCTbQKsFEtD5OV4a8mPePC-67eYyFiA)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|and becomes disabled.|   |   |
||Describing the Effects of Damage<br><br>GMs describe hull point loss in different ways. When your ship's current hull point total is half or more of your hull point maximum, it typically shows no signs of damage. When it drops below half its hull point maximum, it show signs of wear, such as electrical fires or dislodged machinery. An attack that reduces your ship to 0 hit points strikes directly, leaving a massive hole or otherwise disables the ship.||
|INSTANTLY DESTROYED|   |   |

A stable ship doesn't make destruction saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain disabled. The ship stops being stable, and must start making destruction saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable ship that isn't repaired regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

## SHIPS AND DESTRUCTION

Most GMs have an NPC ship explode the instant it drops to 0 hull points, rather than disabling it and having it make destruction saving throws. Special ships are common exceptions; the GM might have them be disabled and follow the same rules as player ships.

DISABLING A SHIP

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a ship, rather than destroy it. When an attacker reduces a ship to 0 hull points with a primary weapon, the attacker can disable the ship. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The ship is disabled and stable.

CHAPTER 10: GENERATING ENCOUNTERS  

reating interesting starship encounters can be a challenging task. Unlike in character-based![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qTfp4q6u7uLSzELk7X_ehaCcgGgsU4Bih3pM3joWLbVqYY_61k-ulfkFG4O-BhphUzU1PJy7ZKqjUQujO6AYeXQCUlun-LHPxsS3sn0GS-It7Wpq-t-xWRK6OMd_EY6jl3FYEEpWLMkbMNjPQ7WTSg)

encounters, DMs are limited by the more constrained nature of space combat: The heroes are confied to an environment that might limit their abilities, and coming up with encounters that do more than just pit two squads of starfighters against one another takes more work. Despite this, creating an exciting starship combat encounter can make an adventure much more memorable, encouraging players to become just as involved as they would be in ground-based encounters.

One of the most important elements of a good starship encounter is giving each player something to do. Gunners should have plenty of targets, a goal that is relatively easy to accomplish. Pilots should have obstacles to maneuver around and ships to fly past, making the environment of the encounter very important. Character combat holds players' interests because each player has something to do in every round. Engaging players in the same manner during a starship combat encounter requires the Gamemaster to design aspects of the encounter that give every player something to do in every round.

Designing a starship encounter that keeps several players active on every turn can be daunting. An alternative solution is to create encounters that encourage players to fly their own starships. For example, in a party of four characters, one character might serve as the pilot of the party's freighter, one character might serve as the gunner aboard that freighter, and the other two would pilot starfighters in the same encounter. This gives three players -- the three pilots -- the ability to move and attack in each round, just as they would in character combat. Even characters untrained in the Piloting skill can perform basic movement and actions, and trained pilots can help protect those untrained pilots during starship combat.

GIVE OBJECTIVES OTHER THAN DESTRUCTION

One of the best ways to make a starship combat encounter more engaging is to give players an objective other than simply eradicating the opposition. Although destroying one's opponents can certainly be a key component in accomplishing that objective, it doesn't necessarily have to be all of it (and, in fact, it rarely is). When designing an encounter, try to pick an objective that allows the heroes to engage their enemy in combat while giving them some other goal to focus on. A goal other than all-out destruction also encourages the players to be more cautious and think tactically rather than just going in guns ablaze. Just as you might not have character combat just for combat's sake, starship combat encounters should serve the purpose of moving the plot forward.

ESCORT MISSIONS

One option for an alternative objective is an encounter in which the players are required to protect something or someone. Escort missions are common among starship pilots in the Star Wars setting, and providing the players with the goal of protecting something from coming to harm means that the players will have to do more than just unleashing their weapons. Protecting something requires more tactical awareness while still allowing for high action and dogfighting that makes space combat exciting. The players might be escorting a ship through hostile territory, defending a transport as it's being loaded, or keeping enemy vessels from detecting a secret base.

BLOCKADE RUN

Alternatively, not all encounters can be won by destroying your enemies; the players might simply be trying to get from one place through another through a series of encounters. The players might be trying to maneuver through a large scale battle toward a specific target, attempting to penetrate the core of a space station, or simply trying to avoid being captured or destroyed.

BASE ASSAULT

Furthermore, you could have your players use their starship to assault a planetary base. Rather than just dogfighting, they might assault a compound featuring turbolaser batteries and walkers.

RETRIEVAL MISSION

Finally, the players might have to task of obtaining something during a starship encounter. This could be a job as simple as using a tractor beam to drag away a derelict ship, or it might involve the heroes actually landing somewhere, obtaining an item, and rejoining the fight. In some cases, the object in question might be a hostile starship, requiring the heroes to disable rather than destroy.

BUILD INTERESTING BATTLEFIELDS

Another key element of good space combat encounters is creating combat arenas that are interesting. Certainly, encounters involving two groups of ships engaging one another in open space can be fun, but adding a certain element of environmental challenge to the encounter makes it much more memorable. Perhaps while fleeing, the characters must fly through an asteroid belt wrought with peril, their pursuit detonating asteroids in an attempt to disable them. Just as in character-scale combat, adding terrain features to space battles creates more lively combat sequences that require creativity and tactical thinking on the part of the players.

The presence of environmental obstacles also creates a more dynamic battlefield, adding another dimension to the placement and movement of starships. Terrain challenges in space combat necessitate movement and encourage players to be more creative in their actions. The following terrain hazards can be part of any space combat sequence.

ASTEROIDS, DEBRIS,

AND ENCLOSED TERRAIN

Space is a lot less empty than one might think, and an environment that contains asteroids, debris, or enclosure is difficult to move through and can potentially damage a starship. Moving through the space of an object hazard requires an Intelligence (Piloting) check, with a DC equal to the size of the obstacle, as shown in the DC column below. On a failure, the ship takes kinetic damage equal to the Damage column.

DAMAGING ENVIRONMENT

Though most combat takes place in a vacuum, some battle might take place in thick dust clouds, the upper atmosphere of a corrosive gas giant, electromagnetically charged nebulae, or even in close proximity to a star--and any of these features can damage a ship. Each hazard functions differently.

## CORROSIVE GASES

Occasionally encountered in planetary atmospheres and some nebulae, corrosive gases can also be the result of massive industrial accident. If a starship enters a corrosive gas field or starts its turn there, the pilot must make a DC 12 Intelligence (Piloting) check. A starship takes 1d6 kinetic damage on a failed check, or half as much on a successful one.

## DUST CLOUDS

Usually encountered as a part of an asteroid field, or as a part of a planetary ring system, light and moderate dust clouds provide very poor visibility. While in a dust cloud, a starship is considered heavily obscured.

## IONIC DISCHARGES

Some nebulae and planetary atmospheres produce nearly continuous discharges of ionic particles. If a starship enters an ionic discharged area or starts its turn there, the starship takes pulse damage equal to half the maximum value of the ship's Hit Die.

## RADIATION

In close proximity to a star or other source of intense electromagnetic radiation, a starship can take substantial damage. Generally, these hazards will cover a large radius, but you might designate some areas as being in the shadow of a planet or moon, negating the effects of the radiation. If a starship enters a radiation proximity or starts its turn there, the starship takes 1 energy damage.

CREATE EXCITING SCENARIOS WITH COMPLICATIONS

One of the best ways to create tension in a space combat sequence is to present complications that affect the way combat takes place. Although battles in which starships simply square off agains one another are fine, a battle with some larger complication can increase the level of tension and excitement.

Complications are factions that affect combat without affecting the battlefield itself.

One of the most often-used complications is a time constraint. Placing a limit on the amount of time--in rounds or otherwise-- that the players have to complete their tasks creates a sense of urgency that makes space combat more exciting. For instance, attacking a superweapon before its weapon fires, or attempting to incapacitate an enemy ship before it makes the jump to hyperspace.

Similarly, limiting the perception or communication of combatants can add an air of the unknown to an encounter. In addition to terrain that impairs visibility, you might include a jamming field that prohibits ships from communicating with each other, or a sensor scrambler that imposes disadvantage on Piloting checks as the ship's onboard computers struggle to

starship feature, or some other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the

condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a starship, each instance of the condition has its own

duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A starship either has a condition or doesn't.

Any conditions that reference the ship also apply to any crew members when they take actions involving the ship. For instance, an ionized ship has

disadvantage on attack rolls. Consequently, a deployed gunner would have disadvantage on attack rolls with a ship weapon, but not with their own weapons.

The following definitions specify what happens to a ship while it is subjected to a condition.

## BLINDED

A blinded ship can't see and automatically fails any ability check that relies on sight or the ship's sensors. Attack rolls against the ship have advantage, and the ship's attack rolls have disadvantage.

## DISABLED

A disabled ship can't communicate with external sources more than 1,000 feet away.

A disabled ship can't take actions or reactions. A disabled ship has 4 slowed levels.

## IONIZED

An ionized starship has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

## INVISIBLE

An invisible starship is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the starship is heavily obscured. The starship's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

## SHOCKED

A shocked starship can't take reactions.

On its turn, a shocked starship can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both.

## STALLED

A stalled ship is disabled (see the condition).

Any active features controlled by the ship, such as a Tractor Beam or Gravity Well Projector, automatically end.

The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

  

## SLOWED

Some abilities, effects, and hazards can lead to a

special condition called slowed. Slowed is measured in four levels. An effect can give a ship one or more levels of slowed, as specified in the effect’s description.

Slowed Level

|2|Speed reduced by 250 feet|
|3|Speed reduced by 300 feet|
|4|Speed reduced to 0, and can’t benefit from any bonus to speed|

  

If an already slowed ship suffers another effect that causes it to be slowed, its current slowed level

increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

An effect that removes slowed reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all slowed effects ending if a ship’s slowed level is reduced below 1.

## STALLED

A stalled ship is disabled (see the condition).

Any active features controlled by the ship, such as a Tractor Beam or Gravity Well Projector, automatically end.

The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

## STUNNED

A stunned ship has 4 slowed levels.

The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

Some special abilities, or when certain conditions are met, cause a ship to sustain a special condition called system damage. such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a

special condition called system damage. System

damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a starship one or more levels of system damage, as

specified in the effect's description.

|4|Hit point maximum, shield point maximum, and shield regeneration rate halved|
|5|Ship becomes permanently "used" (see the condition)|
|6|Ship suffers catastrophic power failure. All primary systems fail.|

If a ship with system damage suffers another effect that causes system damage, its current level of system damage increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A ship suffers the effect of its current level of system damage as well as all lower levels. For example, a ship suffering level 2 system damage 1 slowed level and

disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes system damage reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all system damage effects (except for "used") ending if a ship's system damage level is reduced below 1.

Finishing maintenance reduces a ship's system damage level by 1.

## TRACTORED

A tractored ship has 4 slowed levels.

The condition ends if the tractoring ship is disabled (see the condition).

The condition also ends if an effect removes the

tractored ship from the reach of the tractoring ship or effect.

## USED

A used starship's value is reduced by half.

When a deployed crew member on a used starship rolls a 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they must make a destruction saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, they succeed. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.
