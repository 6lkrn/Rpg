Vigilant Sentinel 

Trained to always keep your wits around them, Guardians are exceptionally valued for their watchfulness. When you attempt to perceive your surroundings on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, you gain a +10 bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect.

  

Gentle Touch

Beneath all the toughness lies a touch that can heal wounds. You have a pool of [Healing](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Healing) power that replenishes when you take a [Long Rest](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Resting#h-Long%20Rest). With that pool, you can restore a total number of 30 [Hit Points](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Hit%20Points).

As an [Action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dybbuk#h-Action), you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of [Hit Points](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Hit%20Points) to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

  
  

  

Taunting Shout

You challenge all opponents within earshot and brace yourself for the fight. All enemy or neutral creatures within earshot must roll a wisdom save throw (DC = 8 + your Cha mod). They gain disadvantage on this roll if they are already in combat. On a success, the creatures ignore you, on a fail, they will try their best to attack you for a number of turns equalling your proficiency modifier. 

  

Safeguard

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.

Combat Maneuvers 

You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You have 5 superiority dices, which you will regain every long rest.

Maneuvers Known  

- ## Ambush: When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.
    
- ## Brace: When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.
    
- ## Disarming Attack: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
    
- ## Evasive Footwork: When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
    
- ## Feinting Attack: You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. 
    
- ## Goading Attack: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
    
- ## Grappling Strike: Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus action (see the Player's Handbook for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check.
    
- ## Lunging Attack: When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. 
    
- Parry: When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
    
- Precision Attack: When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
    
- Pushing Attack: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
    
- Quick Toss: As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.
    
- Riposte: When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
    
- Sweeping Attack: When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.
    
- Trip Attack: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

Slow Fall

You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

Ki

Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of Ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Ki points. You have a starting Ki of 3, which will increase per level.

You can spend these points to fuel various Ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. 

When you spend a Ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended Ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your Ki points.

You use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your Ki ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your Ki ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a Ki feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.

---

Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

---

Ki attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

Deflect Attacks

You can use your reaction to deflect an attack when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is kinetic, energy, or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 Ki point to make an attack as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies.

- You have advantage on Survival checks.
    

Grit

A Cowboy makes their mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some claim they belong to a mystical organisation, but it’s more likely that the volatile nature of combat simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all cowboys have grit. At the start of each day, a cowboy gains a number of grit points equal to their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Their grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). A cowboy spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.

Critical Hit with a Weapon: Each time the Cowboy confirms a critical hit with an attack while in the heat of combat, they regain 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature does not restore grit.

Killing Blow: When the Cowboy reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with an attack while in the heat of combat, they regain 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.

Deeds

Cowboys spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant them some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the Cowboy has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base deeds. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.

Deadeye: The Cowboy can ignore the disadvantage for attacks made at long range. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. 

Cowboy’s Dodge: The Cowboy gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the Cowboy, they can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as a reaction; doing so grants the Cowboy a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the Cowboy can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The Cowboy can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while not encumbered.

Quick Reload: As a bonus action, the Cowboy can reload a single blaster she is currently wielding. The Cowboy must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the Cowboy spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, they can perform quick clear as a free action.

Cowboy Spirit: As long as the Cowboy has at least 1 grit point, they gain the following benefits. First, they gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.  Furthermore, if they have the Quick Draw feat, their hands are free and unrestrained, and the blaster is not hidden, they can draw a single ranged blaster as part of the initiative check.

Pistol-Whip: The Cowboy can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of their blaster as an action. When they do, they are considered to be proficient with the blaster as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to their strength score (minimum 0). The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the blaster. One-handed blasters deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed blasters deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). If the attack hits, the Cowboy can make a strength check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.

Cheat Death: Whenever the Cowboy is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, they can spend all of their remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.

Limited Casting

As a Cowboy, you are able to cast some manner of powers. You gain a 5 pool of mana.

Starting Wealth - 8d4 x 100 cr

Spellcasting

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

BARDIC INSPIRATION

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

JACK OF ALL TRADES

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

SONG OF REST

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

CHORDS OF MAGIC

  

You know how to play songs that will help your allies or hinder your enemies. However, playing magical music takes a lot of toll on one’s body. As such, you are only able to play such chords only 3 times per long rest.

  

Litany of Faith: You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within 30ft that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

  

Drums of War: You play a tempo to lift spirits. All allies within 30ft of you gain an advantage on attacks on enemies till the end of their next turn

  

Ballad of Hope: A willing creature within 30ft of you is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) and gains temporary hit points equal to your Cha modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this spell.

  

Shanty of Luck: All allies within 30 ft of you gain inexplicable luck. For the next 1 hour, they can reroll a single d20 if it was used for an attack roll, ability check or saving throw.

  

Saga of Glory: A willing creature gains a bonus to their attack and damage equal to your Cha mod. This lasts until the end of that creature’s next turn.

  

Melody of Mirth: A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected.  
At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

  

Dissonance Scream: Cause a jarring dissonance in a 60 ft radius. All enemies in this range make an intelligence saving throw. On a fail, they are confused and gain disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of their next turn.

  

Drowning Dirge: Enemies in a 60 ft radius must pass a Con save or be silenced until the end of their next turn.

  

Anthem of Affection: Allies within 30 ft heal for an amount equal to 1d6 + your Cha modifier.

The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. You can command your sapling as part of the same bonus action used to summon it. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the Sapling can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. When you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your Sapling. The Seedling manifests for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

It can undertake a strength (Athletics) check to break free on its subsequent turns. The DC is equal to your spell save.

  

Bramble Barrier

You cause one of your saplings to turn into a wall of brambles. The line is 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each patch touches the ground. These patches are considered difficult terrain and anyone crossing them takes 4d4 piercing damage per 5 ft of movement. Creatures ending their turn in this patch must make a Con saving throw or their movement drops to zero.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

Spellcasting

You have contact with the realm of the dead and gain magic from it, you can cast spells to shape that undead to your will. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shamanic spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to the undead. As a Shaman, you have the mana pool of 8 and will increase per level.

  

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

  

  

Grim Harvest

You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to three times its level of the spell. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

  

Grim Fate

When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.

  

Undead Thralls

You add the animate dead spell to skills. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead it has additional benefits:

The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your level.

The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

  

Inured to Undead

You have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can’t be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

  

Command Undead

You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by others. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

  

Spirit Projection

Your spirit can become untethered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious) and in a state of suspended animation.

Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body.

While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:

- Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    
- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.

Improved Minor Illusion.

You learn the minor illusion cantrip. When you cast a minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

Split Illusion 

When you cast an illusion spell, you can make it so only one individual sees it and no one else.

  

Hypnotic Gaze

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthral another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

  

Instinctive Charm

Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.

You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

  

Illusory Reality

You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. You can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. The Illusion can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

Nanites

  

You can also use your custom microlab to construct nanites equal to 3 + your Int modifier. The creatures that use these nanites must be present, willing, and able to cooperate. Under some circumstances, you can deliver nanites to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll. If you miss your target, the nanites are expended along with the attack’s ammunition. 

  

Nanites can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver nanites to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your range. 

  

If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work and 200 credits worth of parts. You can have only one custom microlab at a time.

  

Nanites come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. 

The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Int ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. 

  

Boosters

- Swiftshot: The target gains 10 ft of movement.
    
- Keenshot: The target adds 30ft of range to their weapons.
    
- Stoneskin: The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.
    
- Focusbeam: The target adds +1 to their proficiency bonus.
    
- Regeneratives: Your target heals an amount equal to your Int modifier every round.
    

  

Basic Inhibitor

A basic inhibitor nanite hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. 

- BrittleGuard: The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.
    

- Lethargy: Your target loses 10 ft of movement.
    
- BloodThinners: Your target only heals half as much from any healing effects.
    
- Vulnerable: Your target loses one type of resistance to damage. 
    

  

A creature can be affected by only one of your nanites at a time. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.

  

  

Theorem

As you gain experience, you devise theories about the way the universe works. Gain proficiency in Int saving throws. You can also help others with your knowledge. When you spend 1 minute explaining a theorem to a willing target, they gain proficiency in the next skill, tool or ability check they make. If they are already proficient this has no effect.
