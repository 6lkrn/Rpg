Aura: The magic of Worldseeker

  

In the world of Worldseeker, there's a natural energy that all macroscopic life emits named aura. The aura can be described as invisible energy that the body creates. Aura is used for many purposes in Worldseeker, but it is mostly hidden away from society as it's power is too extreme and could create imbalances in the world. But how does aura work?

  

The aura system

  

Aura is transmitted through a system similar to the nervous, skeletal and muscular systems called the aura system.  It consists of nerves that cannot be seen with the naked eye called aura nerves. Aura nerves transmit aura throughout the aura system, giving every location in the aura system a balanced amount of aura flow. These nerves are all connected by a nerve called the cerebral aura transmitter or cratter that transmits information to the brain which is what gives the brain the energy to be able to actually fully activate. Without the cratter, there is no aura system or brain. 

  

There are three aura nerves that are usually overran by other aura nerves and as such are usually dormant until they are opened called the aura gates. Aura gates are directly tied to the major organs of the human body and are in the same location. Opening aura gates gives you many special abilities and enhancements due to the time it's been dormant. As such, being older while opening an aura gate causes a greater effect than being younger.

  

Injuring an aura gate can cause severe complications and could result in death. There's many different ways to open aura gates but there are two popular ways of doing it. One way is having such intense emotions and stress while using any of the 5 aura techniques that your aura simply cannot handle the sudden change in aura flow without opening an aura gate. However, this can create dangerous side effects like your system closing aura nerves to balance the immense aura flow or simply not opening the aura gate even though the aura needs the aura gate to open which has the potential to result in death and due to this side effect, it's considered taboo to open it through this way and even illegal to forcibly open another person's aura gates through this way. 

  

The other way is meditating your aura while actively using your Act. Doing this is considered the best way to do it and the safest but it causes incredible exhaustion and more often than not it will not open any aura gates. Meditating your aura while using an Act can also rarely open 2 aura gates at the same time. When this happens, your Act usually becomes much more powerful and easier to use, and you will enhance and have better control of the objective aura techniques.

  

Aura gates also affect subjective aura in many ways. If you open aura gates through intense emotions, your subjective aura will immediately kick in and for a small amount of time your Act will be one with subjective aura and give you supernatural abilities that do not fit the 6 Act categories. Due to this, a temporary Subjective-Objective category will be created just for your ability. Aura gates can also increase or decrease your chances of using subjective aura. However, subjective aura's aura flow can prove extremely dangerous with open aura gates and it's advised to decrease your chances.

  

Aura disabilities

  

Aura systems can also get injured. Aura gates are especially fragile and strong subjective aura can make an untrained aura gate unable to function for a while. Utilizing any form of technique too much can have serious repercussions on your aura system. Aura nerves also need rest and too much overworking can create aura nerve attacks. Cratters can also stop working and effectively kill a user if their aura nerves and gates stop working.

  

Aura nerve attacks are when a nerve seemingly stops working due to exhaustion. This isn't too bad as it will heal over time, but your first aura nerve attack can feel deadly which can make your aura think that is in fact deadly. So it starts stopping other aura nerves to try and restart the stopped one. In rare cases, even aura gates can be stopped. That's why teachings about aura health and disabilities also teach you to be peaceful and let it naturally cure itself. The human's aura system is meant to be perfect for us to completely manipulate, but it still needs to rest.

  

Another disability that aura systems can have is subjective manipulation, which is created when subjective aura flow increases exponentially for whatever reason and becomes stronger than objective aura. Sometimes, this can actually be to the user's advantage and gives them minute control of subjective aura to do anything they want. However, if the subjective aura is too much it can also create too much aura flow that must be filtered out from the system. The system then takes out the subjective aura flow but since there's way too much subjective aura flow, the aura system's aura reserves start to become smaller and smaller until they are effectively gone and the body will then cease shortly afterwards.

  

Aura's connection with living beings

  

Aura acts very similar to a human brain and it is always affected by the person's emotions or state of mind. Aura will believe what the person believes and it can sometimes lie to itself, creating illusions and/or mistakes. Aura and the brain are connected in such a way that humans have found that subjective aura may even have some type of sentience, different from the person's own sentience.

  

Aura can be changed in whatever manner the user wants and it can also experience the placebo effect. Studies show that when somebody was told that aura smells like shampoo before aura control training, the aura actually started smelling like shampoo to other people when they finally began controlling it. TV shows seem to also affect aura in some way, as aura is naturally white and usually feels like a tingle around the body while controlling it, but many rookies have begun to show a yellow or blue aura that felt like wind while augmenting their physical state.

  

Aura with animals and plants

  

Animals and plants can emit subjective and objective aura but can also emit something called natural aura. It can be manipulated while fused with human aura to manipulate the forces of nature like the elements, weather, plants, animals, anything natural. It is unknown why natural aura works this way and why it can be fused with human aura to manipulate forces of nature. It's also unknown why human aura and natural aura are different.

  

All macroscopic animals can emit aura in some way, be it through aura systems or other means. However, an interesting study shows that there is no animal that needs aura to survive. It seems like aura is something that they utilize to augment their bodies. Intelligent animals such as kigs and octopuses seem to have a way to manipulate aura to both augment their bodies and for creating smells or changing their appearance slightly to find a suitable mate.

  

Plants also emit aura, but it seems that aura is something that they can't simply live without, just like humans. Their aura is created through a process called aura collection where they use their roots to spread around aura through the ground and are able to somehow duplicate it and spread the rest around the roots. Scientists are still unsure of how they manage to duplicate the aura but it has been theorized some sort of photosynthesis does this, giving the idea that sunlight gives aura.

  

Aura with humans and kiglings

  

Humans are extremely rare cases, as just as plants, they seem to die if they run out of aura. Also, humans have seemingly perfect aura systems while uninjured, making them able to use aura to its fullest potential. Scientists have theorized that humans might have been the only living beings to evolve their aura system to such a degree that their bodies began needing aura to survive but this is just a theory. 

  

Kiglings have the best aura potential however, as while they also have perfect aura systems, their bodies can survive without aura and can even absorb aura. While kiglings are only 18% of the sentient race population, kiglings are more than 45% of worldseekers. However, kiglings have very slow learning curves due to their bodies not evolving completely to sustain aura, so they have to train more than humans to control aura.

  

The public's perception of aura

  

Aura as a whole is unknown by the public in its entirety. Since aura has the ability to create abilities that can be used for evil, it is kept secret from the public. In the year X5, information about aura and it's uses was leaked and shown through articles and newspapers. While the Worldseekers eventually succeeded in persuading the public that it was not true, the concept of aura created misconceptions, conspiracy theories and ideas that were eventually incorporated into fiction and even religions.

  

Currently, the public think of aura as a religious concept. However, many supernatural occurrences have happened in recent times, making the public believe that there is something that the Worldseekers and the governments of the world aren't telling them.

  

Subjective aura

  

Subjective aura is aura that comes from aura nerves that subconsciously causes an effect created by strong emotions or a deep resolve in the person but it can also be created by seemingly mundane things. Subjective aura is very powerful but very rare. It is impossible to control and cannot be brought out intentionally. As such, the only training that happens about subjective aura is how to control yourself and control your aura flow whenever it occurs.

  

Subjective aura can be fatal if you have 2 or more aura gates open, as the amount of aura flow is so overwhelming that all of your aura could possibly expulse out of your body when it happens. As such, people with 2 or more aura gates have to go undergo emotional training to not let any emotions or any resolve they may have take over in any situation. This is notoriously difficult, as it's thought that aura gate opening can make emotions rampant and create aura imperfections, which are little dots created by strong emotions and are in the aura system and they usually block out a portion of an aura nerve, lowering the amount of aura flow. It's also been shown that animals have much better control over subjective aura with their imperfect aura systems being able to use subjective aura in life or death situations at will, but the reason why has not been found.

  

Subjective aura can affect Acts to such a degree where they can create the absolute opposite effect it was supposed to do. Subjective aura is truly unpredictable and can create an array of abilities that help the user. Subjective aura also seems to contain precognition as some abilities may not be helpful at first but will be later in life, making many believe that everybody has a destiny and that fate exists and that subjective aura is destiny in aura form. Many categorizations of subjective aura have existed for various years.

  

Categorizations of Subjective Aura

  

Desire type: This type can subconsciously guarantee the odds of getting something they desire. Desire aura is weak and is sometimes unable to be felt by using Sense and apparently feels like cold wind.

  

Curse type: this type can subconsciously curse somebody. The curse can vary between "I curse you to always fall down when you wake up on a Tuesday" to "I curse you to be insane for all eternity". Curse aura feels like someone is looking at you from far away.

  

Transfer type: This type can subconsciously transfer a "weakness" to another person. This weakness might not necessarily be an actual weakness but something the user thinks is limiting him. These are very vague and if depressed with your physical appearance it is possible somehow to transfer your consciousness into another body that you might think is more physically attractive. Transfer type can only be felt by the two people in the transaction and it is very varied.

  

Sacrifice type: This type can subconsciously sacrifice something the user possesses for something else. It contains precognition abilities as something that might not be immediately useful will definitely be useful later in life. It's been said that it feels like complete sadness at first but then euphoria afterwards.

  

Divination type: This type can subconsciously finds information that the user needs. It has the ability to show the user the future, past events, events that are occuring at the same time, tell the user invaluable secrets and to read lies.

  

Levy type: this type is basically all other types that are not the other 6. This is the most common type as there's simply too many things subjective aura can do. 

  

Worldseekers and Subjective Aura

  

Worldseekers have a rocky relationship with subjective aura. When the Worldseeker Organization was created, they spent large amounts of money in subjective aura research as they saw how potentially powerful it could be. However, the research just added more questions than answers. Eventually, the Worldseeker Organization stopped the research entirely and labelled it as uncontrollable. This created a stigma about subjective aura from the worldseekers. 

  

Many worldseekers still think that subjective aura doesn't need to be trained at all and that it will always be impossible to control. However, many objective aura masters realize the importance of subjective aura and have mastered ways of being able to sense subjective aura and to make one with subjective aura and their aura gates, creating aura gates that are adept for subjective aura.

  

Objective aura

  

Objective aura is the type of aura that can be controlled and used to its fullest potential. Objective aura has been fully explored potential wise, with some humans and kiglings been able to create Acts that can bend time and space. Objective aura can come from both aura nerves and aura gates.

  

Objective aura is the aura Worldseekers and other people control. Objective aura can be made in whatever color, smell, or taste the user wants. Objective aura is used mostly for combat purposes but it can also be used for other purposes. While normal humans and kiglings usually can't feel aura, objective aura masters with all 3 aura gates open can make normal humans feel their presence and it apparently feels like a tingling sensation around their body to the untrained aura system.

  

Objective aura is completely tied into the user and is the part of aura that will think whatever the user thinks. Unlike subjective aura, it seems like objective aura has no precognition abilities. One major difference between objective and subjective aura besides the control each has is the fact that objective aura uses sentience from it's user while subjective aura has sentience of its own.

  

Controlling objective aura

  

Objective aura is usually difficult to control at first, since usually rookies have no experience with aura systems or nerves. Most worldseekers start with 5 single steps. The first step to control objective aura is changing your aura to whatever smell, taste, temperature or color you want. This requires some type of meditation called aura shaping where you meditate while thinking about your aura for example having a shampoo-like smell. Another way of doing this is using the placebo effect to make your aura already have a certain smell, taste, temperature or color which is quicker but does not always work. Giving your aura a quality makes summoning your aura easier at the cost of your aura's quality potentially making stealth situations harder, which is why some masters have no aura qualities.

  

The second step is finding out what your natural affinity is. There are many tests to find this out but it is usually done with a therapist who gives you a personality test as well as studying what Zodiac you belong to. It can take a long time depending on the personality of the person. 

  

The third step is to learn how aura nerves, aura gates, aura systems, objective aura, subjective aura, aura techniques and aura as a whole works. It is best advised to do this individually with a teacher, as many people have different ways of learning and learning curves are vastly different in this particular subject. Opinions vary on it's difficulty, but the general consensus is that it's the least tedious step.

  

In the fourth step, you will learn the 4 basic techniques: Keep, Stop, Release and Sense. These can take from around a few weeks to a few months. This step is the most important of all and it is almost impossible to open any aura gate without knowing these techniques. Lie is completely optional and is usually skipped but most aura masters seem to utilize Lie more than the other 3. 

  

In the fifth step, you learn Acts to learn all the categories and how they work, how Acts work and how it's tied to your brain and body, how Limitations, Restrictions and Conditions work and also how Act Gates work. This is the last step before you can fully control your aura. There's too many different ways to master aura control however and it depends on your category affinity, how you open your aura gates and the way you utilize aura.

  

Objective Aura Techniques

  

Keep: a technique that makes all aura nerves in your body transmit your aura outside the body in a healthy way. The amount of aura that is transmitted always is an indicator of how much aura flow your aura nerves and aura gates create. Using Keep is purely defensive and can protect the user against attacks augmented with objective aura or Keep can be trained to protect the user from subjective aura damage. Keep is easy to do but hard to master as you must be in a state that is described as being one with objective aura to truly master.

  

Stop: the technique that makes every aura nerve and perhaps opened aura gates stop transmitting aura all throughout the body. It is not instantaneous, as that would kill the user. Rookies usually can do it in about an hour but aura masters can do it in less than 1 minute. This technique allows the user to essentially conceal themselves from Sense and relax aura nerves and gates. Opening your aura nerves after Stop is instantaneous, although gates take time to open once again. Stop is recommended after Release and Sense, as it helps the aura nerves and aura gates relax after but it is not recommended to use Stop for more than a couple of minutes unless trained in aura conservation.

  

Release: the technique that makes your aura nerves and perhaps opened aura gates transmit aura quicker and faster all throughout the body. There's 2 forms of Release called Instantaneous Release and Formal Release. Instantaneous Release is of course instantaneous and the aura flow increases exponentially than they would with Formal Release, leading to amazing physical strength and an increase to your Act's abilities. However, Instantaneous Release can lead to serious fatigue even for only a minute and even create powerful aura nerve attacks. Formal Release is much safer but it is very slow compared to the former. 

  

Sense: the technique that makes your objective aura able to feel aura unless they're using Stop. This can be used for both objective and subjective aura, although people who can truly sense subjective aura are rare. It is formed when the aura nerves vibrate to a point where nearby aura nerves instinctively vibrate back, where then the user can feel the aura vibrations. It is unknown why aura nerves vibrate in such a manner instinctively. Using Sense before using an Act is a bad idea as the vibrating aura nerves can create distortions in your Act. Using Sense right after Stop can create aura nerve attacks.

  

Lie: this technique can be the most important one or the least important one. It depends a lot. This technique allows you to essentially lie to your aura and manipulate it to think something else. Using Lie to your aura about your aura nerves not working properly is one of the ways this technique can be used that if done right will make the aura nerves much stronger and more resistant to damage. Lie can be used with Keep, Release, Sense and Stop.

  

Explode: An advanced technique that is done when using Formal Release and also utilizing Lie. If done correctly, the Formal Release will exponentially increase aura flow instantly and to even greater extent than Instantaneous Release due to Lie being used to make aura think the user is in fact utilizing Instantaneous Release but without the side effect of fatigue or nerve attacks. It has been observed that Explode is very difficult to control and will not do the desired effect if not emotionally ready.

  

Hide: Hide effectively hides the aura flow instead of stopping it completely, giving some offensive capability while still having stealth. Hide does not relax aura nerves however and Focus can still sense the aura flow. It is considered a middle ground between Stop and Keep, but Hide's small defensive capabilities can be combined with Formal Release to create the ultimate stealth technique, using Formal Release's expanding aura flow and Hide's aura containment to deceive other aura users. 

  

Focus: The advanced form of Sense. Focus vibrates the aura nerves slowly instead of rapidly like Sense. Focus can be used after Stop or before utilizing an Act and has less chance of having aura nerve attacks. Focus' slowly vibrating nerves can create a pattern that can sense people using Hide. 

  

Read: Read can perceive the aura to read the individual. This can used to see a person's emotions, health, physical strength and aura strength. This can be used subconsciously as well when on high guard. Using Sense or Focus beforehand is needed to use this technique to its full potential.

  

Aura Field: A larger, harder way of using Keep. While using Keep, you also use Formal Release that creates a bigger field of aura around it's user. This aura field can be utilized to detect people inside of it and can also conjure, manipulate, reinforce, transmutate and illusionate anything while that's inside of the aura field. The size varies drastically, but masters can create fields 80 feet wide. Solidification of an aura field is very difficult and usually is not perfect. Conceivably though, an aura field can trap someone for all of eternity if they have infinite aura and an infinite lifespan. 

  

Infuse: Infusing pure aura with objects or bodies. Can be used to track people, enhance or heal people with Reinforcement, fuse objects with Conjuration, manipulate objects or sentient beings with Manipulation, changing the shape and properties of an aura infused object or body with Transmutation and changing how an object or body looks, smells, tastes, feels or sounds with Illusionism. 

  

Mimic: Mimicking the aura of others. It does not mimic Acts in their entirety, however you can mimic certain properties of the aura of others such as the scent and color to deceive people into thinking you're someone else and many other things. Very easy to do at first but mastering it takes absolute talent and precision.

  

Shape: Shaping your pure aura to be anything. This can be done by any category and it is very easy to create. Shaping your pure aura to be a sword for example won't be too strong unless your aura flow and control are great. Using Shape is usually used for the same weaponry as changing the shape of your aura every time you use Shape can make your pure aura construct weaker. That's why keeping the same shape or only changing small parts of the same shape is optimal for power.

  

There are many other techniques that have been created since the conception of aura control but these 13 techniques are the most known and the ones that are taught to all Worldseekers.

  

States of Objective Aura

  

Objective aura has states, in which different effects can occur. These states can vary wildly depending on their natural affinity, Keep mastery and aura flow.

  

Solid: This aura state is the most known and the natural state that objective aura takes normally. A solid aura state is seen as the natural way but it is advised to not overuse this state as aura can get too comfortable and make it harder to switch between states. 

  

Liquid: This aura state makes aura run like a valve and clouds the user with liquid aura. This aura state should always be used during meditation as a liquid states facilitates aura and physical meditation to a tremendous degree.

  

Gaseous: This aura state makes the aura emit like a gas. This state should always be used when not combating or using any of the techniques. A gaseous state is great for changing the shape of aura and matter and emitting scents or sounds. Usually relaxes aura gates and sometimes aura nerves.

  

Plasma: This aura state is wild and varies greatly. The only sure thing known about this state is that it enhances aura flow and aura techniques to a tremendous level, but aura is unable to keep this state for a long time without succumbing to aura nerve attacks and loss of aura flow.

  

Hibernation: This aura state basically makes it so you can't utilize any aura technique at all and rests your aura nerves similar to Stop. However, getting out of the hibernation state gives you extreme power after awakening. How much power depends on how long Hibernation has been used. It is known to be very difficult to keep and get an actual change in power.

  

Acts

  

This is the 14th technique that can be created and it's the most versatile and the one that's the most highly coveted. This technique can create supernatural abilities from the aura of a user. It's name is aura expression but recently it's been called Acts by the majority due to it being basically a personal expression of how you view your aura and what you want it to do and how it acts with you. 

  

Acts are tied with your emotions, willpower and overall your entire existence. You create an Act however you want and it is utterly pointless to copy abilities because the Act will not work with your aura if you didn't put time and effort into it. Subacts are also real, which are supernatural abilities that are added seemingly subconsciously by your Act without you doing anything. Contrary to popular belief, Subacts are not created subconsciously and are actually created by your aura's understanding of your Act and the aura adding abilities that it thinks could help you. Subacts don't have categories and as such can give powers that do not fit in the 5 Act categories. Acts and Subacts has many things that make it so highly coveted and versatile. There are 6 categories.

  

Conjuration

  

The category that creates objects out of your aura or summoning objects or creatures out of your aura. Worldseekers or people who specialize in this category are called Conjurers or C1. Conjuring material objects is usually the most common application of this category. Usually, the material objects have types of Stipulations or Requirements that make it ultimately an Act to be reckoned with. There are 3 types of Conjuring.

  

1. Creation: The most widely common way of Conjuring. It can be described as just creating solid objects out of aura. It is temporary and the time when it gets erased can vary. Conjured objects that eradicate when damaged or after a very short time are more powerful and easier to produce, and vice versa with Conjured objects that don't get eradicated when damaged. 
    
2. Summoning: summoning or calling something to appear out of your aura. While it might be seen as Creation at first, it actually is not created from thin air, just summoned from another location.
    
3. Teleportation: using your aura to teleport an object into another location without moving. This method is difficult to do but quite powerful.
    
4. Fusion: using two or more objects to fuse together to conjure an object. Seen as weak but has high potential.
    

  

Conjurers are often considerate, sensitive and creative. The color that represents Conjuration is yellow. 

  

Reinforcement

  

The category that reinforces you in many ways with aura. Worldseekers or people who specialize in this category are called Reinforcers or R2. Reinforcement is usually seen as the easiest category to use by Worldseekers. Acts specializing in Reinforcement usually take on multiple forms of Reinforcement and are usually simple but effective. Reinforcement has 6 main types.

  

1. Enhancement: using your aura to enhance anything to do with your physical body. This is the most common way of using Reinforcement.
    
2. Augmentation: using your aura to augment the amount of something in your body or other things. This is used very creatively by many Reinforcers, but augmenting the blood flow and aura flow is the most common way of using Augmentation.
    
3. Enlightenment: using your aura to advance your mind in any way. This is also used to enhance the way you utilize Acts from other categories.
    
4. Adaptation: using your aura to adapt to your environment. Usually used for against other Acts.
    
5. Hypersensitivity: using your aura to heighten your senses in any way.
    
6. Restoration: using your aura to heal wounds, illnesses and very rarely aura disabilities.
    

  

Reinforcers are often charismatic, have high potential for aura mastery and prone to anger. The color that represents Reinforcement is blue.

  

Transmutation

  

The category that has the ability to change the shape of aura-infused matter and change the properties of matter through aura or the properties of aura itself. Worldseekers or people who specialize in this category are called Transmuters or T3. Transmutation is seen as one of the hardest categories to incorporate into Acts due to all the studying necessary to create a combat oriented Act. There are 4 types of Transmutation.

  

1. Mimicking: the most common way Transmuters use their abilities. Mimicking certain properties of other objects on their aura.  
    
2. Shapeshifting: being able to change the shape of your own body through aura. 
    
3. Alteration: being able to alter the forms and structures of other objects. Extremely hard to use this type of Transmutation.
    
4. Alchemy: being able to purify and perfect an object from another source. Very difficult and vague.
    

  

Transmuters are often troublemakers and street-smart. They both copy and create trends. The color that represents Transmutation is the color red.

  

Manipulation

  

The category that can manipulate solid objects or living things through aura. Worldseekers or people that specialize in this category are called Manipulators or M4. It is seen as a very versatile category that allows for many abilities. Manipulation is also apparently an easy category to incorporate into Acts. Manipulation is seen as a mostly  ranged category. There are 5 Manipulation subtypes.

  

1. Telekinesis: being able to detach and manipulate aura or an aura infused object and controlling it. The most common form of Manipulation.
    
2. Brainwashing: Being able to manipulate a sentient being into saying anything the user wants. Stipulations, Requirements and Limitations are usually needed for this to work perfectly.
    
3. Puppetry: being able to control a sentient being's body.
    
4. Necromancy: being able to control a person who has died and their bodies.
    
5. Levitation: detaching aura and manipulating it to levitate straight upwards. Very situational.
    
6. Push/Pull: telekinetically push against an aura infused object to go flying backwards or pulling to do the opposite effect. Also situational but useful.
    
7. Emanation: detach aura from the body to manipulate it further. Often seen as the most useful subclass. 
    

  

Manipulators usually tend to be arrogant about their abilities, formal and have exceptional memory. The color that represents Manipulation is the color purple.

  

Illusionism

  

The category that uses aura to change how the senses, brain and aura of other beings perceive things. Worldseekers and people who specialize in this category are called Illusionists or I5. This is a different category than the rest as an Illusionist's abilities aren't actually real. However, with enough training and studying, the effects of these abilities can indeed become real. Illusionism is seen as hard to incorporate in Acts as it's different from the other categories in many ways. There are 4 types of Illusionism.

  

1. Sight Projection: changing how the sight views the world. This is the most common way of utilizing Illusionism.
    
2. Pain: making the brain believing that the pain receptors are activated, creating intense pain. Difficult but powerful.
    
3. Solidification: making the illusions solid, making them able to be touched. Varies on its usefulness.
    
4. Mental Projection: projecting their thoughts, emotions and consciousness through illusions.
    
5. Smell Projection: making the victim smell something that isn't real.
    
6. Hearing Projection: making the victim hearing something that isn't real.
    

  

Illusionists usually have a facade of some kind, their personality can change very quickly and they are selfish and selfless at the same time. The color that represents Illusionism is the color orange.

A category named Compound might be on its way. It is basically all other supernatural abilities that don't fit in Transmutation, Illusionism, Conjuration, Manipulation or Reinforcement. It is said to be the most powerful and wildest category, as there are no defined terms on what is possible. This category could be created due to the influx of Acts and Subacts that do not fit in the past 6 categories. Compound abilities could very well be on the Worldseeker Categories after a while. 

  

Limitations, Stipulations, Requirements, Restraints, 

  

As Acts are tied into your willpower and emotions, putting strict Stipulations, Limitations or Requirements in your Act can make the ability much more powerful and easier to utilize. 

  

1. Limitations: Putting strict limits on what your ability can and cannot do. Limitations cannot be broken in anyway. Vague Limitations that contain potential for loopholes are less powerful, but strict Limitations that basically are unable to have loopholes are stronger.
    
2. Stipulations: Putting strict Stipulations on what your ability can and cannot do. Stipulations can indeed be broken as they're not Limitations just the user restricting themselves from doing something with an ability. Limitations are more like laws of physics and reality, while Stipulations are more like jurisdictional laws. Stipulations won't do much without some kind of repercussion. The more restrictive a Stipulation is and the more consequential a repercussion is, the more powerful the Act.
    
3. Requirements: putting certain Requirements that when followed give the user the ability to use their Act. Requirements are more like activation laws that will make the Act not work unless certain Requirements are achieved. The more restrictive and harder a requirement is, the stronger it'll become.
    
4. Restraints: your aura restraining you from using your Act. There can be a variety of reasons why, however usually it's because the ability is too powerful and cannot be created without putting Limitations, Stipulations or Requirements.
    
5. Drawbacks: imposing an ultimate weakness for an ability. You can make ultimate drawbacks that if defined and specific will make your power not very powerful but if you impose a vague drawback, your ability can become even stronger.
    

  

Act Gates

  

When first creating and using your Act, it will not usually do the desired effect very well and imperfections can occur. Act Gates help you to control your Act and even make it more powerful. Contrary to popular belief, Act Gates are actually real. These gates seem to "open" whenever you utilize your Act in the current form it is in to its fullest potential, increasing the control, power, range and speed it has and maybe even adding powerful Subacts. 

  

Theoretically, Acts have infinite potential as it seems there is no limit to Act Gates. Aura masters have exploited Act Gates to such a point where space control and time control Acts are possible to create, making Worldseekers realize that another category might be on its way. 

  

Act Gates can also open during Hibernation states and are in fact more likely to open during this state then in any other. Act Gates also are called expression gates. There are many forms of Act Gates.

  

1. Subacts: Giving a powerful subact to accompany an Act.
    
2. Limitations: Giving the option to break Limitations sometimes.
    
3. Subjective: Combining an Act or Subact with subjective aura to increase the power temporarily and even giving a subjective aura ability.
    
4. Control: Giving you a better control over your Act. 
    
5. Strength: Giving your Act newfound strength.
