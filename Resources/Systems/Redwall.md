REDWALL D&D REFERENCE NOTES 

OVERVIEW 

Is this little writeup formatted according to Standard D&D Homebrew Add-Ons? No. Is Redwall a fun D&D setting  anyway? Yes. But you already knew that, or you wouldn’t be reading this. Here are the general notes I’ve been  using for my campaign, which you are free to use as inspiration for your own.  

Playable Races. These aren’t necessarily balanced against D&D official races or other homebrews, but they are  balanced against each other, and that’s all that really matters here. My goal was to reflect the typical portrayal of  each race in the books, without locking players into specific classes. I used the same template to create each one: 

- Two boosts to their ability scores (+2 to a primary attribute, +1 to a secondary attribute) - Two saving throw proficiencies 

- Two skill proficiencies 

- Two other proficiencies (weapons, tools/kits/instruments, or free cantrips) 

- Two race-specific features 

Enemies. I have been freely looting the standard 5e monster manual, making modifications as necessary to reflect the setting – giant hungry herons, marauding warbands, ghosts. This one’s up to you. 

Setting. Let your imaginations run wild! We can all agree on the locations of Redwall Abbey in the middle of  Mossflower Wood, with Saint Ninian’s on the road nearby; Salamandastron on the coast and the sea to the west; the ruins of Kotir somewhere under it all. Other than that I – like Brian Jacques before me – am making up new cave systems, small settlements, islands, and land features left and right as the campaign requires. 

Deities. In my campaign, I have let players invoke the spirit of Martin the Warrior, the Spirit of the Seasons, or other heroic ancestors as best fits their character. 

Magic. And therein lies the rub. I’ve justified its existence in my own campaign with some expansions on the setting (more on that in the Setting section) and by restricting the schools of magic to exclude most necromancy and any kind of extraplanar shenanigans. You may choose to ban it entirely and have a nonmagical campaign. 

Regarding Canonical Information About The Mossflower Region According To Brian Jacques. “The code is more  what you’d call guidelines” than actual rules.” 

Obviously, change whatever you want to my notes in order to develop a setting and a campaign that works for you. The world is your oyster.

THOUGHTS ON SETTING 

Redwall, as depicted by Brian Jacques, is a great setting for D&D narratively… but not mechanically. He doesn’t  include the kinds of cities and taverns that players are used to; there is no real mention of trade or exploration;  there is no magic and, ironically, no religion. The only supernatural events in the books are sightings of Martin the  Warrior during plot-critical moments. 

In my campaign, I decided the best and simplest way to address this without severely limiting the players to  certain classes or backgrounds was to expand the world outside of Mossflower, rather than changing Mossflower  itself. 

The way that Brian Jacques describes the Redwall world reminded me of England during the Dark Ages: a lot of  unmapped wilderness, largely lacking roads and infrastructure, and at the mercy of any local warlord. The biggest  settlements are either religious or military in nature (or both.) Travel and trade are limited. However, during the  same period, other civilizations were experiencing great growth and success, rich with learning and commerce.  

I embraced that model and suggested to my players that the Mossflower region we all know is, compared to the  rest of the world, a benighted backwater. Somewhere across the seas or over the mountains, they might find  towns and cities, academies of learning, merchant ports… all the classic hallmarks of a D&D setting. (Still populated  by talking animals, of course.) 

This, in turn, helped me create a place for magic to exist within the world. Perhaps magic is only uncommon in  Mossflower, where the occasional squirrel druid or fox sorceror puzzles out how to use their innate powers  without dying in some mystic accident. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, some young voles are sitting down  with their instructor at an enchanter’s institute. Magic is all around… Its users, on the other hand, are scarce. 

I requested that my players avoid the most immersion-breaking forms of magic (anything extraplanar) and go easy  on the necromancy, transmutation, and evocation. However, enchantment, abjuration, and illusion are working  out great.  

Feel free to borrow this model if it works for your campaign, come up with a different justification, or decide to  limit your players’ abilities to only match what the characters in the books can do. Really. Go wild. I won’t know.  I’m sharing how I made my campaign, not telling you how to run yours.

PLAYABLE RACES 

Goodbeasts & Vermin. The version of Redwall in which I run my campaign is more integrated than Brian Jacques’,  with traditionally “goodbeast” and “vermin” races mingled at about a 1/5 ratio. Anybeast may encounter prejudice  in their chosen society, but there are no “born evil” races.  

Sizes. The books give the following impression of size comparisons (which bears little relation to real-life animals):  

- Giant: Large serpents, eagles, herons 

- Large: Adult badgers, wildcats, owls, giant toads 

- Medium, including those who are tall/long and those who are bulky, in roughly the following tiers:  1. Pine martins, monitor lizards, young badgers 

2. Foxes, ferrets, sea otters, hares, sea rats, crows, small toads, small serpents  

3. Squirrels, river otters, stoats, weasels, common rats, hedgehogs, moles, lizards, frogs - Small: Mice, jerboas, dormice, shrews, voles, sparrows, small newts 

- Tiny: Pygmy shrews, bats 

Generally speaking, mice & other small creatures are about waist high to an adult badger. Medium creatures will  range between rib and shoulder high. 

Variations. Some of the races here are closely related, such as the different varieties of shrews and otters. Related  races share their primary attribute, but not their secondary; both saving throws; one skill proficiency; one other  proficiency; and one racial trait. 

There are dozens more creatures (or variations on existing creatures) not included in my notes which could be fun  to play. Additionally, some of these I have listed are incomplete, because my players decided what they wanted to  be while I was still brainstorming, and I didn’t need to keep wracking my brain about what truly defines a vole.  Please feel free to change, edit, or rewrite these templates as you see fit. 

For my thought process in some cases, see footnotes. 

TRADITIONAL GOODBEAST RACES 

- Badger (juvenile)1 

o Size: Large Speed: 25 Vision: standard 

o Ability Score Increases: +2 Strength, +1 Constitution 

o Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution 

o Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, History2 

o Other Proficiencies: (1 Martial Weapon of choice), (1 Tool of choice) 

o Racial Features: 

▪ Bloodwrath3: When you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, you can drop to 1  HP instead. This can only occur once per long rest. 

▪ Powerful: Your unarmed fists do 1d4 bludgeoning damage, increasing at levels 5 (1d6),  11 (1d8), and 17 (1d10), plus your Strength modifier. 

1 To avoid a massive power imbalance, for my campaign I specified that any Badger PC must be young/untrained. 2 Badgers, being long-lived and with an extensively mapped family tree spanning the region, get a boost to History  checks. 

3 The Bloodwrath trait is inspired by the Half-Orc racial traits.

- Mousekind4: Mouse 

o Size: Small Speed: 30 Vision: standard 

o Ability Score Increases: +2 Constitution, +1 Charisma

o Skill Proficiencies: (1 Skill of choice), Religion 

o Other Proficiencies: (1 Simple Weapon of choice), (1 Tool/Kit/Instrument/Game of choice) o Racial Features: 

▪ Lucky5: If you roll a 1 on the d20 for an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the  die and must use the new roll. 

▪ Brave6: You have advantage against being frightened or intimidated. 

- Mousekind4: Jerboa 

o Size: Small Speed: 35 Vision: standard 

o Ability Score Increases: +2 Constitution, +1 Dexterity 

o Saving Throws: Dexterity, Constitution 

o Skill Proficiencies: (1 Skill of choice), Athletics 

o Other Proficiencies: (1 Simple Weapon of choice), (1 Tool/Kit/Instrument/Game of choice) o Racial Features: 

▪ Lucky5: If you roll a 1 on the d20 for an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the  die and must use the new roll.

o Ability Score Increases: +2 Wisdom, +1 Strength 

o Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity 

o Skill Proficiencies: Performance, Survival 

o Other Proficiencies: Rapier, (1 Instrument of choice) 

o Racial Features: 

▪ Gregarious: You have advantage on all Charisma-related skill checks (Deception,  

Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion) when in the company of close allies. 

▪ Mighty Legs: Once per turn, you can use your action to kick an opponent instead of  attacking with your weapon. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be  knocked prone, taking 1 damage. The DC for this saving throw is 10 + your Strength  

modifier + your Dexterity modifier. 

4 Mice (and rats), being the most widespread and populous races in the Redwall world, are also the most versatile  in terms of racial traits. One cannot generalize what sorts of skills or training a mouse (or rat) would have. Instead,  I gave them the widest range of customization options, and a boost to their Constitution, reflecting their resiliency  rather than their toughness. 

5 The Lucky trait is inspired by the Halfling racial traits. 

6 The Brave trait is inspired by the Halfling racial traits. 

7 I considered making Lagomorph: Hare and Lagomorph: Rabbit variants, but couldn’t come up with useful  distinctions except that Rabbits might be smaller and less martial.

impenetrable ball of spikes, raising your AC to 18. While curled, you are immobile and  

blind. Any successful attack made against you with a melee weapon (excluding weapons  with the Reach characteristic) incurs 1d4 piercing damage upon the attacker. You may  

uncurl at will on any subsequent turns, which is considered your movement for that

▪ Subterranean: Your vision is too poor to use any ranged weapons. You have  

disadvantage on attack rolls and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the  target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. 

- Squirrelkind: Squirrel 

o Size: Medium Speed: 35 Vision: standard

11 I have very little impression of the “classic qualities” of a vole, except that they are like mice with worse  personalities. Feel free to come up with any modifications or a second feature that suits you.

rendered a second attempt physically impossible. This can only occur once per long rest. ▪ TBD 

12 Rats (and mice), being the most widespread and populous races in the Redwall world, are also the most versatile  in terms of racial traits. One cannot generalize what sorts of skills or training a rat (or mouse) would have. Instead,  I gave them the widest range of customization options, and a boost to their Constitution, reflecting their resiliency  rather than their toughness. 

13 Searats, by definition, travel a great deal, hearing stories, rumors, and legends, which manifests as a boost to  their History skills. 

14 I am not in love with this trait and would welcome suggestions of alternatives.

15 I struggled to differentiate the different mustelid variations, but wanted them all to be represented in the game.  My impression from the books is that pine martins are the most charming, ferrets and weasels the most crafty, and  stoats… less crafty, but tougher. Otherwise, I considered them to be another very versatile race and gave them a  range of customization options similar to mice and rats, based on player choice. 

16 The Forgotten Stash trait is inspired by the Adventurer’s League Kender racial traits.

▪ Carrion Breath18: You can use your action to exhale a fetid cloud. Every creature in a 15'  cone in front of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison  

damage, or half as much on a successful save. The DC for this saving throw is 8+ your  

Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This can only occur once per long rest. 

▪ Cold-Blooded and Scaly: You are resistant to slashing damage, but you are vulnerable to  cold. In very chilly conditions, you must succeed on regular Constitution saving throws  

to avoid penalties. 

17 I struggled to differentiate the different mustelid variations, but wanted them all to be represented in the game.  My impression from the books is that pine martins are the most charming, ferrets and weasels the most crafty, and  stoats… less crafty, but tougher. Otherwise, I considered them to be another very versatile race and gave them a  range of customization options similar to mice and rats, based on player choice. 

18 The Monitor Lizard and its traits are inspired by the Dragonborn race.

FORAGING AND COOKING 

Food is such a huge part of the Redwall series that I want to incorporate it into gameplay whenever possible. It is a  great way to add a non-combat challenge into the game. 

Foraging. As a great lover of cooking shows, I wanted to design a “Chopped”-style challenge for my players, with randomized ingredients to utilize in roleplaying scenes and skill challenges. I compiled a list of 100 forageable  resources that can be found in the Mossflower region (based on real resources naturally available in the UK.) The  rules are straightforward: 

1. On a foraging excursion, each participating player may make a number of forage attempts equal to their  Perception, Survival, or Nature modifier – their choice. 

• If the resulting number is zero (or negative), the player may roll a d100 to find one random  resource from the combined forage tables. (Essentially, they stumble across something useful by  sheer dumb luck.) 

• If the resulting number is one or more, the player may instead make a targeted search with each  forage attempt by specifying a kind of resource (Greens, Vegetables, Fruits, Herbs, Fungus, or  Other), and roll a d10 or d20 as indicated. 

2. The resources found become the ingredients available for the cooking challenge that follows. It can also  be used as simple flavor text (pun intended) without an impact on gameplay.  

The forage rules can be modified by – for example – allowing players to stack modifiers when determining the  number of forage attempts possible; deciding whether each resource found is a single item of its kind, or an  unlimited set of items they can harvest at will; or making growing season a factor.  

A similar project for fishing rules is still in development. 

Cooking. For actual cooking, I refer to Cecilia D’Anastasio’s “How To Cook: Variant Rules For Players Who Like To  Cook What They Kill” homebrew, available as a PDF from the Dungeon Master’s Guild website. This is a fun  mechanic to turn cooking into a creative skill drill for the whole party, rather than a single dice roll from the one PC  who spent a skill proficiency on Cooking Tools. The target DC of the cooking checks, and any consequences or  benefits, are up to the DM’s discretion.

MAPS 

I used information from the Redwall books about the relation of different parts of the abbey to each other, to  

drawn approximate maps of the grounds & interior. Roughly speaking, the books describe the following areas: 

o Walls: belltower in northern wall, main gate in the western wall, small gates in the north, south, and east. 

o Grounds: lawns, ponds, orchards/gardens, beehives, and gatehouse. 

o Cellar: small forge/workshop, underground spring, unknown maze of shelves, ramp up to kitchen. 

o Lower level: Cavern Hole, kitchen, ramp down to cellars, NW stairs upwards. 

o Ground level: Great Hall, abbot’s study, tapestry, main doors, NW stairs downwards, NE stairs upwards. 

o Upper levels 1 & 2: lofted dormitory levels, infirmary, NE stairs upwards/downwards. 

o Attics: storage, library, NE stairs upwards/downwards to bell tower, sparrow loft, roof. 

Additional rooms and spaces can be added as necessary. My handwriting is what it is.
