# Creating Characters

  

# Quick Character Creation

1. Pick a Pulp Archetype.

2. Allocate 90 to the core characteristic, and then 80, 70, 60, 60, 50, 50, 40 where you like among your other characteristics.

3. Choose two Pulp Talents.

4. Choose an age (no adjustments need be made).

5. Calculate Damage Bonus and Build (see page 23).

6. Calculate Hit Points (CON+SIZ divided by 5) and Luck (2D6+6 x 5).

7. Decide on an occupation and select eight appropriate occupation skills.

8. Allocate the following values among the eight occupation skills and Credit Rating: one at 80%, two at 70%, two at 60%, three at 50% and one at 40% (set the skills directly to these values and ignore the skill base values). If your chosen profession states a lower Credit Rating skill than 40%, you should set an appropriate Credit Rating skill value and distribute the excess points elsewhere.

9. Pick five non-occupation skills and boost them by 20% (adding 20 to the skill base values).

10. Add bonus skill points from the Pulp Archetype as desired (suggest picking two or three skills to bolster).

11. Roll for backstory details then elaborate on them later, during play.

12. Start playing.

13. Fill in half and fifth values during play.

14. Sort out money if and when you need it.

# Archetype

## Adventurer

A life without adventure is not worth living. The world is a big place and there is much to experience and many chances for glory. Sitting behind a desk, working a job nine to five is a death sentence for such folk. The adventurer yearns for excitement, fun, and a challenge.

## Beefcake

Physical, muscular, and capable of handling themselves when the chips are down. Born that way or has worked hard in the pursuit of physical perfection.

## Bon Vivant

A bon vivant is “one who lives well,” but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are rich. While many are accustomed to wealth, the bon vivant is someone who could be said to enjoy life to the fullest and damn the consequences! Why wait until tomorrow when you can start living life today? Enjoying food and drink, as well as other pleasurable pursuits, is the key to a lifestyle where excess is the norm. Whether poor or rich, such a person puts little thought to saving for a rainy day, preferring to be the center of attention and a friend to all.

## Cold Blooded

A rationalist who is capable of just about anything. Cold blooded types may follow some twisted moral code, however, their view of humanity is cold and stark; you’re either good or bad. There are no shades of gray to navigate, just the harsh realities of life and death. Such people make effective killers as they have little self-doubt; they are ready to follow orders to the letter, or pursue some personal agenda for revenge. Such people may do anything to get the job done. They are rarely spontaneous people; instead, they embody ruthlessness and premeditation. Sometimes they will try to fool themselves into believing they have a “line” they will not cross, when in reality they are merciless and will go to any length to fulfill what they see as their goal.

## Dreamer

Whether an idealist or visionary, the dreamer has a strong and powerful mind. Such types tend to follow their own direction in life. The dreamer looks beyond the mundane realities of life, perhaps as a form of escapism or because they yearn for “what could be,” wishing to right wrongs or improve the world around them.

- Suggested traits: idealist, optimist, lazy, generous, quiet, thoughtful, always late.
    

  

## Egghead

Everything can be broken down and analyzed in order to understand how it works. Knowledge is a treasure and a joy—a puzzle to explore. Where the scholar is bookish, the egghead is practical and thoroughly enjoys getting their hands dirty. Whether it’s wires and gears, valves and computational engines, or blood and bones, the egghead likes to figure out what makes things tick. Perhaps an absent-minded genius or a razor-sharp virtuoso, the egghead can easily become absorbed in the problem before them, leaving them exposed and unaware of what is actually happening around them.

Depending on the pulp level of your game, the egghead may be able to invent all manner of gizmos, useful or otherwise, see Weird Science on page 86 for details.

## Explorer

“Don’t fence me in,” is the oft-heard cry of the explorer, who wishes for a more authentic and fulfilling life. Strong willed, virtually unshakeable, the explorer is ever questing for what lies over the horizon. Possibly at one with nature, such types are content to sleep where they fall, happily disdaining the soft comforts of urban life. Whether hacking through jungles, squeezing through caverns, or simply charting the hidden quarters of the city, the explorer is often a misfit who grows restless and annoyed by those they consider to be “weak” or “cowards.”

- Suggested traits: outcast, brave, misfit, loner, bullish, strong willed, leader, restless.
    

  
  

## Femme Fatale

A deadly woman or man whose outward beauty usually masks a self-centered approach to life; one who is ever vigilant. By constructing an alluring and glamorous persona the femme fatale is akin to a spider. She draws others to her web in order to possess what she desires or destroy her target. Brave and cunning, the femme fatale is not shy of getting her hands dirty and is a capable foe. Neither is she foolhardy, and she will wait until her web is constructed before dealing out a sudden and well-timed assault (be it mental or physical). A classic pulp archetype, the femme fatale could as easily be termed homme fatale if so desired.

- Talents: any two (Smooth Talker talent recommended).
    
- Suggested traits: alluring, glamorous, wicked, deceitful, cunning, focused, fraudulent.
    

  

## Grease Monkey

The grease monkey is practically minded, able to make and repair all manner of things, be they useful inventions, machines, engines, or other devices. Grease Monkeys may be found lurking under the hood of a car, or playing with the telephone exchange wires. Such types have a “can do” attitude, able to make the most of what they have at hand, using their skills and experience to wow those around them.

Depending on the pulp level of your game, the grease monkey may be able to “jury-rig” all manner of gizmos, useful or otherwise; see Weird Science on page 86 for details.

- Suggested traits: practical, hands-on, hard working, oil-stained, capable.
    

  

## Hard Boiled 

Tough and streetwise, someone who is hard boiled understands that to catch a thief you have to think like a thief. Usually, such a person isn’t above breaking the law in order to get the job done. They’ll use whatever tools are at their disposal and may crack a few skulls in the process. Often, at their core, they are honest souls who wish the world wasn’t so despicable and downright nasty; however, in order to fight for justice, they can be just as nasty as they need to be.

## Harlequin

While similar to the femme fatale, the harlequin does not like to get their hands dirty (if they can help it). Usually possessing a magnetic personality, although not necessarily classically beautiful, such types find enjoyment in manipulating others to do their bidding, and often hide their own agendas behind outright lies or subtle deceptions. Sometimes they are committed to a cause (personal or otherwise), or act like agents of chaos, delighting in watching how people react to the situations they construe.

- Suggested traits: calculating, cunning, two-faced, manipulative, chaotic, wild, flamboyant. 
    

  
  

## Hunter

Maybe it’s the thrill of the chase, the prize at the end, or just because they have an innate drive to master their environment, the hunter is relentless in pursuing their prey. Calm and calculated, the hunter is willing to wait for the most opportune moment, despising the reckless behavior of the unwary.

## Mystic

A seeker of the hidden, explorer of the unseen realm; the mystic quests for secrets and the fundamental truth of existence. They may be book-learned academics, shamanistic healers, circus diviners, or visionaries, but all pursue knowledge and the experience of forces outside of the natural order, be it for personal gain or the betterment of mankind.

With the Keeper’s permission, a mystic is able to tap into supernatural powers beyond the ken of average folk. Often they have been persecuted and hunted, hiding their “gifts” from those who would call them “witch,” while others are considered charlatans and little more than sideshow freaks. Such heroes must take the Psychic talent, allowing them to invest skill points in one or more psychic skills (see Psychic Powers, page 83).

## Outsider

The outsider stands apart from the rest of society, either figuratively or literally. Such people may be alien to the environment in which they find themselves, perhaps from a different country or culture, or they are part of the society but find themselves at odds with it. The outsider is usually on some form of journey, physically or spiritually, and must complete their objective before they can return to, or at last feel part of, the greater whole. Often the outsider will have distinct skills or a different way of approaching things; utilizing forgotten, secret, or alien knowledge.

## Rogue

The rogue disobeys rules of society, openly questioning the status quo and mocking those in authority. They delight in being non-conformists, acting on impulse and deriding conventional behavior. Laws are there to be broken or skirted around. Most rogues are not necessarily criminals or anarchists intent on spreading chaos, but rather they find amusement in pulling off stunts that will confound others. They are often sophisticated, governed by their own unique moral codes, loveable and careless.

## Scholar

Uses intelligence and analysis to understand the world around them. Normally quite happy sitting in the library with a book (rather than actually facing the realities of life). A seeker of knowledge, the scholar is not particularly action orientated; however, when it comes to the crunch, he or she might be the only person who knows what to do.”

## Sidekick

The sidekick embodies aspects of the steadfast, rogue, and thrill seeker archetypes. Usually, a younger person who has yet to live up to their full potential, someone who seeks to learn from a mentor type figure, or those content not to be the center of attention. Alternatively, the sidekick wishes to belong, to be the hero but is overshadowed by their peers or mentor. Subordinate sidekicks can at times struggle against their (usually) self-imposed restraints, venturing off on flights of fancy that mostly just get them into trouble. Sidekicks usually possess a strong moral code of duty and responsibility.

## Steadfast

Moral righteousness runs thickly in the blood of the steadfast. They protect the weak, put the interests of the others before themselves, and would willingly sacrifice their life for another’s safety. Whether they follow a clear spiritual or religious path or some internal moral code, they do not stoop to the depths of others, fighting with honor and acting as role models to those around them. Whatever else they fight for, they also fight for justice.

- Suggested traits: unwavering, loyal, resolute, committed, dedicated, firm but fair, faithful.
    

  

## Swashbuckler

Passionate and idealistic souls who are always looking to rescue damsels in distress. Gallant and heroic, the swashbuckler is action-orientated and fights fairly, disdaining the use of firearms as the tools of cowards. Most likely boastful, noisy, and joyous, even when in the direst of situations. A romantic at heart, a swashbuckler possesses a strong code of honor but is prone to reckless behavior that risks more than just their own life.

- Suggested traits: boastful, gallant, action-orientated, romantic, passionate, highly-strung. 
    

  

## Thrill Seeker

Some people are like moths to a flame. For them, the easy life is no life at all, and they must seek out adventure and danger in order to feel alive. The stakes are never high enough for thrill seekers, who are always ready to bet large in order to feel the rush of adrenaline pumping through their veins. Such daredevils are drawn to high-octane sports and activities, and for them, a mountain is a challenge to master. Foolhardy to a fault, they cannot understand why no one else is prepared to take the same risks as they do.

Two-Fisted

“Live fast, die hard” is the motto of the two-fisted. Such individuals are storehouses of energy, strong, tough, and very capable. Such types are inclined to resolve disputes with their fists rather than words. Usually hard-drinking and hard-talking, they like getting straight to the point and dislike pomp and ceremony. They do not suffer fools gladly. The two-fisted seem to live life in a hurry, quick to anger, contemptuous of authority, and ready to play as dirty as the next guy.

# Characteristics 

### Base Characteristics

Use the following rolls to determine each of the characteristics, although substitute a roll of 1D6+13 multiplied by 5 for the hero’s core characteristic (as determined by the archetype chosen in Step One).

  

- Strength (STR): roll 3D6 and multiply by 5.
    

Strength measures the muscle power of an investigator. The higher it is, the more the investigator can lift or tightly cling to something. This characteristic determines the damage an investigator inflicts in hand-to-hand combat.

  

- Constitution (CON): roll 3D6 and multiply by 5.
    

Constitution represents health, vigor and vitality. Poisons and diseases may directly challenge an investigator’s constitution. Investigators with a high constitution often have more hit points, the better to resist injury and attack.

  

- Size (SIZ): roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5.
    

Size averages both height and weight into a single number. Size helps determine hit points and damage bonus and build.

  

- Dexterity (DEX): roll 3D6 and multiply by 5.
    

Investigators with higher Dexterity scores are quicker, nimbler and more physically flexible. An investigator with zero DEX is uncoordinated and unable to perform physical tasks.

  

- Appearance (APP): roll 3D6 and multiply by 5. 
    

Appearance measures both physical attractiveness and personality. A person with high APP is charming and likable, but may lack conventional good looks.

  

- Intelligence (INT): roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5. 
    

Intelligence represents how well investigators learn, remember, analyze information and solve complex puzzles. An investigator with zero INT is a babbling, drooling idiot. Intelligence determines the number of Personal Interest skill points (multiply INT × 2) allotted to a new investigator

  

- Power (POW): roll 3D6 and multiply by 5. 
    

Power indicates force of will: the higher the POW, the higher the aptitude for, and resistance to, magic. An investigator with zero POW is zombie-like and without ‘purpose’, as well as being unable to use magic. Unless stated otherwise, POW that is lost during the game is lost permanently.

  

- Education (EDU): roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5. 
    

Education is a measure of the formal and factual knowledge possessed by the investigator. EDU is a factor in determining how many Occupational skill points an investigator begins with, and represents the investigator’s starting percentage for the Own Language skill.

  

Write the result for each characteristic on the Pulp Cthulhu hero sheet, and also write in the half and fifth values for each of them—entering the values alongside the full characteristic percentage:

- Divide the percentage value by two, rounding down, and enter for the “half ” percentage value.
    
- Divide the percentage value by five, rounding down, and enter for the “fifth” percentage value.
    

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Str+Siz|Damage Bonus|Build|
|2-64|-2|-2|
|65-84|-1|-1|
|85-124|None|0|
|125-164|+1d4|+1|
|165-204|+1d6|+2|
|205-284|+2d6|+3|
|285-364|+3d6|+4|
|365-444|+4d6|+5|
|445-524|+5d6|+6|

Add an additional 1D6 to Damage Bonus and +1 to Build for each additional 80 points or fraction thereof.

  

Age: Choose any age that is appropriate for your character. Age does not play a role in wonderland.

### Other Attributes

- Luck: roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5.
    
- Sanity points (SAN): equal to POW. 
    
- Hit points (HP): add CON and SIZ together, then divide the total by 5 (round down). 
    
- Magic points (MP): equal to one-fifth of POW.
    
- Damage Bonus (DB) and Build: add STR to SIZ together and look up the total on Table 1: Damage Bonus and Build. 
    
- Movement Rate (MOV): compare DEX, STR, and SIZ as per the following table
    

  
  
  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Str+Siz|Mov Rate|
|If both DEX and STR are each less than SIZ|Mov 7|
|If either STR or DEX is equal to or greater than SIZ, or if all three are equal|Mov 8|
|If both STR and DEX are each greater than SIZ|Mov 9|

#  Skills

## Occupation Skills

After you have chosen an occupation, calculate your occupation skill points using the characteristics specified alongside the occupation. Allocate the resulting total as percentage points among those skills listed for the occupation—your hero’s professional skills. Points must also be allocated to Credit Rating (see following) within the range indicated for the occupation.

  

Not all the skills need to have points allotted to them; however, any unused points are lost. 

  

Note that each skill has a number in brackets next to it on the pulp hero sheet: this is the base chance of success in that skill, and any points allocated to that skill are added to this base number. There is no cap on the number of points that can be invested into a skill, although players are advised that a hero with a variety of skills in the 40%–80% range (rather than possessing only three or four skills at 90%–100+%) is liable to be more useful in the game, as their breadth of ability means they won’t become “one-trick ponies.”

  

Write down the total points for each skill on the pulp hero sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed on the sheet). The sheet also has space to write in the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing you to reference them quickly in the middle of a game. See Table 7: Quick Reference

Chart for Half and Fifth Values on page 43. It is advised that you allocate occupation skill points, archetype skill points, and then personal interest skill points before writing in the half and fifth values alongside the full value for each skill.

  

## Archetype Skills

Decide which of the skills listed under the chosen archetype you wish to allocate the bonus points to. Some of the archetype skills may be the same as ones listed under the chosen

occupation; decide whether to bolster such skills or round out the hero further by electing to use the bonus points for non-occupation skills. Archetype bonus skill points cannot be used for skills not listed under the archetype, and if unallocated are lost.

  

Note that if your hero has a psychic skill, (see Step Three:Determine Pulp Talents, page 23) then you will also need to invest skill points into that skill.

  

## Personal Interests

Multiply the hero’s INT by 2 and allocate the result as points to any skills (which can include adding further points to occupation skills). Note that points cannot be allocated to the

Cthulhu Mythos skill unless otherwise agreed with the Keeper.

  

Write down the total points for each skill on the pulp hero sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed on the sheet). 

  
  

## Credit Rating

A hero’s starting Credit Rating (CR) is determined during character creation, based on the hero’s chosen occupation. In play, Credit Rating determines the amount of money a character has available on hand, as well as their assets and general living conditions.

  

A hero’s Credit Rating skill begins at zero. The range of starting levels for each occupation can be broad, and the level chosen should reflect the hero’s rank in that occupation. For example, a criminal could be a poor, lone pickpocket (Credit Rating 9) or for a wealthy gang boss (Credit Rating 90). Any number of skill points can be invested in Credit Rating within the recommended limits for that occupation.

  
  

## Using Luck

Players may use their hero’s Luck score to affect certain outcomes or die rolls in the game. A player may only spend Luck to affect their own hero.

### Adjusting Skill or Characteristic Rolls

Cost: 1 for 1 basis

After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or characteristic), Luck points may be spent to alter the result. The player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1 for 1 basis.

  

### Adjusting Weapon Fumble or Firearm Malfunction Outcomes

Cost: 10 Luck

When a roll indicates a melee weapon fumble or a firearms malfunction, 10 Luck points may be spent to ignore the result. The actual die roll result is not adjusted and the attack is still a failure. Luck is spent to avoid the dire consequences of the roll, allowing the hero to avoid a weapon breaking or a firearm jamming, and so on.

  

### Halving Sanity Loss

Cost: double the Sanity point loss

When a Sanity roll has been failed, the number of Sanity points lost may be halved by spending Luck points equal to double the Sanity loss. For example, a hero is about to lose 8 Sanity points from seeing a horror from beyond (the Keeper has rolled 1D10 to figure the loss). The hero spends 16 Luck points in total, reducing the loss from 8 to 4 points Note that heroes with the Resilient Talent (see page 25) can also apply its effect to the Sanity loss, after the Sanity loss has been halved by spending Luck.

### Avoiding Unconsciousness

Cost: 1 Luck point, doubles each round thereafter Whenever a hero fails a CON roll to remain conscious, or if they suffer automatic unconsciousness, they may spend 1 Luck point to remain conscious until the end of the current round.

Cost doubles for every extra round 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on—and should be spent at the start of each round.

As soon as their Luck points run out or if they no longer wish to spend Luck, they immediately fall unconscious.

  

### It’s Only a Scratch!

Cost: 20 Luck

Wounds can sometimes look a lot worse than they actually are. Pulp heroes are able to call upon their inner reserves and gain an instant health boost to reduce the damage they have received. When damage has been taken, a hero may spend 20 Luck points to gain an immediate 1D6 hit points recovery. Hit points gained may not exceed the hero’s maximum hit point total. 

  

### Avoiding Certain Death

Cost: all Luck points, 30 points minimum spend required If a hero has 30+ Luck points remaining, all of these Luck points may be spent to bring a hero back from the brink of death. The hero has avoided certain death and immediately regains 1D6+1 hit points, turning up in the next scene in an appropriate state. 

The player (possibly assisted by the Keeper and other players) should describe what happened; how their hero managed to survive what seemed like certain death.

  

### What Luck Cannot Buy

Luck points cannot be spent on:

• Luck rolls.

• Adjusting damage rolls.

• Altering the result and outcome of a pushed roll.

• Sanity rolls (Luck may be used to adjust Sanity losses, but not the Sanity roll itself).

• Skill experience checks (as per the Hero Development Phase).

In addition, heroes only receive skill experience checks for skill roll successes made without spending Luck points.

  

### Recovering Luck

The player rolls 1D100 and if the roll is higher than their current Luck score they add 2D10+10 points to their Luck score. If the roll is equal to or less than the hero’s present Luck score, 1D10+5 Luck points are recovered.
