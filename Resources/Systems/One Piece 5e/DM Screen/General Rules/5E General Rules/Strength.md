Measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump

## **Strength Table (Race / Class Breakdown):**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><em>Strength</em></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><p><strong>Measures:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Natural athleticism, bodily power</p><p> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Important for:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Fighter, Barbarian, Paladin</p><p> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Racial Increases:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Mountain dwarf (+2)</p><p>Human (+1)</p><p>Dragonborn (+2)</p><p>Half-Orc (+2)</p><p>Earth Genasi (+1)</p><p>Goliath (+2)</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **General Examples of Strength:**
• Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
• Break free of bonds
• Push through a tunnel that is too small
• Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
• Tip over a statue
• Keep a boulder from rolling

## **Attack Rolls and Damage:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin.</p><p> </p><p>You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Athletics (Strength Skill)** 
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming.</p><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote><p>Examples include the following activities:</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid-jump.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Lifting and Carrying:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong><u>Carrying Capacity</u></strong></p><blockquote><p>Your carrying capacity is your <strong>Strength score multiplied by 15</strong>. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><strong><u>Push, Drag, or Lift</u></strong></p><blockquote><p>You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (<strong>30 times your Strength score</strong>).</p><p>While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><strong><u>Size and Strength.</u></strong></p><blockquote><p>For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift.

## **Variant Lifting Rule (Encumbrance):**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple.
