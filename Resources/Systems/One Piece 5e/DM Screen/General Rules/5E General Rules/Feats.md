title: Feats
---

## **Feats:**
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character Special capabilities. It embodies Training, experience, and Abilities beyond what a class provides.
 
At certain levels, your class gives you the **Ability Score Improvement** feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.
 
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.
