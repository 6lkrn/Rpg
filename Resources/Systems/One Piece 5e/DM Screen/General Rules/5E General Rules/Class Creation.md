Guidelines to Homebrewing Classes in D&D 5e

Created by /u/JamesMusicus

Important: This document is not about balancing classes. This document analyzes all of the existing 5e classes to create guidelines for creating new ones in the same line of thought.

Note: If anybody uses this to create their own classes, I’d appreciate a citation if you post it anywhere. Even if you don’t post it, let me know how it worked for you! (reddit /u/jamesmusicus)

Let's take a look at this in regards to the archetypes.

- Most common levels to gain archetype features are 6, 10, and 14.
    
- Second most common are 7, 11, 15, and 17.
    
- Least common levels are 8, 9, 13, 18, and 20.
    
- Levels to avoid are 4, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 19 (levels of ability score improvements and extra attack
    

- All casters EXCEPT Bard get Archetypes at levels 1 and 2. They also mostly stick to levels 6,10, and 14 (except of course Cleric and Sorcerer)
    

- At level 1, Classes that have a power source defined by their archetype pick archetypes. (cleric, sorcerer)
    
- At level 2, Classes that learn to use magic and then specialize pick Archetypes (druid, wizard)
    
- At level 3, Classes that can specialize into non-magic fighting pick Archetypes. (fighter, Bard, Paladin)
    

Nobody (except Clerics) gets Archetype features at the same levels as ABSI, clerics only get a weapon/cantrip improvement to make up for only getting a situational class feature at level 5

  

When designing a class, decide on class roles (listed above) and draft a class table based on other classes of those roles along with the observations above.

  

Every class gets SOMETHING at every level, be it an ABSI, new Spell slot level, class feature, or archetype feature.

At the levels Spellcasting classes gain higher spell levels, they usually do not gain Class Features. Exceptions include the Cleric’s Destroy Undead and lvl17 domain feature, the Bard’s Song of Rest and Bardic Inspiration, the Sorcerer’s Metamagic, and the Warlock’s Pact Boon. All of these exceptions are either relatively minor or do not affect spellcasting at all.

  

Spellcasting classes have 2 categories: Prepared Spellcasters and Spontaneous Spellcasters

Prepared Spellcasters can prepare a number of spells, from a list of available spells, equal to their Spellcasting Modifier (INT/WIS/CHA) + their relevant class level.

Spontaneous Spellcasters have a limited list of learned spells which are available to them. This list is chosen and modified as the caster levels up and learns new spells.

Wizards are an exception, their Spells Known is in their spellbook, which they prepare spells from. 

  

Spellcasting classes do not get any more ABSIs than the standard minimum. This rule may be broken if one were to homebrew a Martially focused spellcasting class.

  

Spellcasting classes also know cantrips, which represent a spellcaster’s basic attacks. The number of cantrips known increases with level, but classes vary greatly.

  

When choosing proficient saves, a class’ spellcasting modifier is always a proficient save.

At the levels Halfcasting classes gain higher spell levels, they usually do not gain Class Features. Exceptions include the Paladin’s and Ranger’s Extra Attack, which they get at the same level as their level 2 spell slots.

  

Halfcasting classes have 2 categories: Prepared Spellcasters and Spontaneous Spellcasters

Prepared Spellcasters can prepare a number of spells, from a list of available spells, equal to their Spellcasting Modifier (INT/WIS/CHA) + their relevant class level.

Spontaneous Spellcasters have a limited list of spells which are available to them. This list is chosen and modified as the caster levels up and learns new spells.

  

Halfcasting classes do not get any more ABSIs than the standard minimum. This rule may be broken if one were to homebrew a Martial halfcasting class.

  

Halfcasting classes do NOT know cantrips normally. This is because they focus equally on spellcasting and on martial ability. Their weapons fill the role of cantrips.

  

Halfcasting classes are half-spellcaster and half-weapon-user, so keep this in mind when using this template.

QUARTERcasters are people who gain spellcasting through a class archetype at level 3.

  

They probably CAN be prepared Casters, but the Eldritch Knight and Arcane Trickster are both Spontaneous Casters. It is likely that quartercasters will always be considered spontaneous casters to reduce bookkeeping.

  

This can only be added to classes that don’t have any spellcasting ability.

  

Quartercasters may have additional ABSIs

  

Primarily Weapon users with supplementary magic.

Saves are split into 2 groups: Weak (STR/INT/CHA) and Strong (DEX/CON/WIS). Pick 1 from each group.

## Class Types

- Tactician (Skirmisher, Halfcaster)

Class Design Template

1. No casting, Full casting, Half casting, or something new
    
2. Primary Stats (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA)
    
3. Archetypes
    
4. Hit Die
    

1. Proficiencies
    
2. Saving Throws (2 groups: STR/INT/CHA and DEX/CON/WIS. Pick 1 from each group.)
    

6. Additional ability score improvements on top of the ones at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19?
    

1. 1 = lvl 10
    
2. 2 = lvls 6 and 14
    
3. 3? = 6, 10, and 14?
    
4. 4 = please no
    

8. By level 3, Characters should have 2-3 core/strength class features and their class archetype.
    

  

Start with broad strokes. Decide between No casting, Full casting, Half casting, or something new. Figure out what possible archetypes there could be. If you can’t think of any archetypes, maybe it would be better suited to being an archetype of a current class.

  

Hit Die

Hit die range from d6 to d12, though only Barbarian has a d12.

D6: squishy people with little physical fortitude. These are usually going to be ranged characters that are in severe danger should they be caught in melee range of a barbarian or fighter. (wizards, sorcerers)

D8: average fortitude, not somebody with a disordinate amount of physical ability, usually average athleticism. Probably the squishiest melee classes get. (clerics, bards, monks)

D10: the strongest most people are going to get. These people are on the front lines soaking up hits and protecting everyone else. Their damage output won’t be as consistently high as someone with less physical fortitude. (paladins, fighters, rangers)

D12: superhuman fortitude. These people can ignore pain like nobody else. Reserved for Barbarians and similar classes.

  

Features come in 3 forms, Core, Strength, and Flavor

Examples of Core: Sneak attack, Rage, Bardic Inspiration, Metamagic, Spellcasting, Channel Divinity, Lay on Hands. These are unique between classes and serve to both increase a class’ power and to define the niche that the class fills.

Examples of Strength: Fighting style, Ability Score Improvement, Extra Attack, Improvements to any Core features. These are common among classes and serve to greatly improve the power of the class.

Examples of Flavor: Druidic, Thieves’ Cant, Tongue of the Sun and the Moon, Timeless Body, Natural Explorer. These serve to make a class more defined and/or versatile without strictly enhancing their overall combat power as a class. Most classes have at least one flavor feature, fighter seems to be an exception.

  

Capstone Features are something special entirely. When you reach level 20 in a class, you get a feature that is both Core and Strength that gives your class the ability to keep fighting throughout a longer adventuring day (unlimited rages and STR/CON+4, Ki when you roll initiative, more uses of bardic inspiration, Epic paladin abilities, etc.)

  

No Casting:

1. Do they get a fighting style or do they get something like Rage or Sneak attack to make them special as a martially focused class.
    

1. Which Fighting Styles do they choose from, should you write new ones?

[Better Psionics by Caoimhe Snow](http://boldpueblo.com/downloads/5e/5e-houserule-psionic-classes.pdf)

Unused Idea: Combat Awareness

  

Combat Awareness (or any better name)

Your focus in combat heightens to extraordinary levels. A few things, listed below, cause you to gain and lose combat awareness. You require Combat awareness to fuel your class features. You can not have more stacks of combat awareness than your class level + your relevant Ability Score. Any attack or feature that spends CA can not generate CA at the same time, and will spend the CA instead of Generate it.

  

Things that Generate stacks of Combat awareness.

- Hitting with a weapon attack once per turn (+1CA)
    
- Getting Healed (+1CA)
    
- Hitting with an opportunity attack (+1CA)
    
- Receiving the Help action from an ally for an attack. (+1CA from relevant attack)
    

  

Things that spend stacks of Combat awareness.

- Class Features
    
- GETTING HIT (1 CA)
    
- Not dealing damage or spending CA for 1 round. (1 CA)
