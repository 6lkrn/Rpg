### Falling Off the Ship
Rough water adds 5 to all the following DCs except for checks made when more than 5 feet under the surface. Flotsam or other floating items grant advantage to checks  to stay afloat.

### The Fall
This can be hazardous to your health. If you fall overboard you will splash down 1d6+5 feet from your ship. If you are pushed overboard you will fall 2d6+5 feet from your ship. If you [[Jump|jump]] or dive into the water you can enter the water at any point up to the maximum distance you can [[Jump|jump]] (refer to the Jumping rules in the Player’s Handbook). If you fall or are pushed overboard, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to enter the water without damage. Otherwise you receive 1d6 hit points damage from the fall.

### Swimming
Each foot you swim cost you one extra foot of speed. If you are within 5 feet of a moving ship (or one that has been involved in a ramming or grappling manoeuvre), you must make as DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Failure means that you cannot move this round, you are using all of your strength to simply keep your head above the waves. Once you reach the ship, you must make as DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb back onto the ship. Failure results in you falling back into the water.

### Underwater
You can swim underwater as long as you can hold your breath (see “Drowning” below). Your underwater swimming speed is the same as your surface swimming speed. You can swim straight down at half that speed. You can swim straight down at 15 feet per round if holding the equivalent of medium [[Armour|armour]], or 25 feet per round if holding the equivalent of heavy [[Armour|armour]]. If unencumbered, you can swim straight up at 20 feet per round.

### [[Armour|Armour]]
In general, heavy [[Armour|armour]] is not terribly common on [[Ships|ships]]. The weight tends to be the most prohibitive factor – falling overboard in 65-pound full plate normally results in death. Occasionally, combat Infantry will don light or medium [[Armour|armour]] for a battle, but most of the time sailors go unarmoured. A lucky few (usually the PCs and important NPCs) have magic items that improve their AC, but most sailors rely on their natural Dexterity.

#### Light Armor
Attempting to swim while wearing light [[Armour|armour]] requires that you make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check each round. Failure means you have a speed of 0 as you go under water for that round and loose one carried item, [[Shield|shield]] or weapon (your choice as to what you drop).

If you choose to remove your [[Armour|armour]] after entering the water, it will take one minute (10 rounds). A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check will cut that time in half. During this time you cannot swim or take any other actions. You make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check each round. Each round that you succeed you keep your head above water and counts as one round of the rounds required to remove your [[Armour|armour]]. Failure means that you went under water this round and made no headway in removing your [[Armour|armour]]. After 3 failures you receive one level of exhaustion.

#### Medium Armor
You can attempt to swim while wearing medium [[Armour|armour]], but you must make DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check each round. On a success, if you are on the surface at the beginning of the round, you stay on the surface. Each foot you swim cost you two extra feet of speed and you can take no other actions besides shouting and stowing a weapon. A failed check means you sink 10 feet and lose any still-carried shields or [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons|weapons]]. On the round following a failed check you are under water. After that, on a successful check  you can swim toward the surface at a rate of 15 feet per round. On failure you sink another 10 feet.

You can attempt to remove your [[Armour|armour]], but you will be sinking at a rate of 10 feet per round during this time. It normally takes 1 minute (10 rounds) to doff your [[Armour|armour]], but a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check will cut that time in half. Without your [[Armour|armour]] you can swim toward the surface at a rate of 20 feet per round.

#### Heavy Armor
You cannot swim while wearing heavy [[Armour|armour]], giving you an effective speed of 0. Whenever you are in water, you lose any carried shields and [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons|weapons]] and begin to sink. You make a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check each round. Success keeps your head above water, or if you start the round under water you can swim 15 feet toward the surface. You can take no other actions. A failed check means you sink another 20 feet.

You can attempt to remove your [[Armour|armour]], but you will be sinking at a rate of 20 feet per round during this time. It normally takes 5 minutes (50 rounds) to doff your [[Armour|armour]], but a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check will cut that time in half. Without your [[Armour|armour]] you can swim toward the surface at a rate of 20 feet per round.

###### Drowning
After 1+(con bonus) minutes of holding your breath underwater you fall unconscious, your hit points fall to 0, and you can then survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). After that, you begin making your death saving throws as per the standard rules. However, if you become stable there is a problem. If you are still under water you can’t remain stable. So you must start making death saving throws again. This continues until you die unless you are saved in some way.
