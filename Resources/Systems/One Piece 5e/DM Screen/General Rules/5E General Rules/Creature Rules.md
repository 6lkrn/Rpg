# **Creature Size:**

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature o f a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

Size Categories

Size Space
Tiny 2.5 x 2.5 ft.
Small 5 x 5 ft.
Medium 5 x 5 ft.
Large 10 x 10 ft.
Huge 15 x 15 ft.
Gargantuan 20 x 20 ft. or larger

Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures

Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

**Monster AC, Hit Points**


# **Armor Class** 

| A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value. |

# **Hit Points** 

A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the player’s D&amp;D basic rules or the Player’s Handbook.

A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).

A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. Hit Dice by Size Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die Tiny d4 2½ Small d6 3½ Medium d8 4½ Large d10 5½ Huge d12 6½ Gargantuan d20 10½ A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

 
# **Speed** (Burrow, Climb, [[Fly|Fly]], Swim)**

A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the player’s D&amp;D basic rules or the Player’s Handbook. All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Movement|movement]] modes.

**Burrow.** A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
**Climb.** A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Movement|movement]] to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Movement|movement]] to climb.
**[[Fly|Fly]].** A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Movement|movement]] to [[Fly]]. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to [[Knock]] out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the player’s D&mp;D basic rules or the Player’s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
**Swim.** A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Movement|movement]] to swim.
