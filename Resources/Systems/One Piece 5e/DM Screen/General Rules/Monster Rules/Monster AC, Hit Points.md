**Monster AC, Hit Points**


# **Armor Class** 

| A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value. |

# **Hit Points**

Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points.
