title: Madness

## **MADNESS**
In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.
 

## **GOING MAD**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.</p><p> </p><p>Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Madness Effects**

## **Rage of Demons Madness**
At the best of times, the Underdark is a bizarre, alien, and inhospitable world, but the influence of the demon lords has transformed it into a domain of madness and chaos. Faerzress acts as a catalyst, spreading the demon lords’ madness throughout the Underdark. When adventurers enter the Underdark, begin taking into account the effects of demonic madness on the characters’ sanity (see “Madness” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
 
At various times during Rage of Demons, characters will be called upon to make a saving throw to resist some madness-inducing effect. In addition, characters might have to make a saving throw against madness whenever one of the following events occurs:

-   The characters encounter or witness something particularly alien or disturbing (such as a demon lord).

-   The characters stay in a faerzress-suffused area for a long time (eight or more consecutive hours).

-   A character takes psychic damage, particularly in an area suffused with faerzress. In adventures set during Rage of Demons, madness is measured in three levels.

 
**Madness Levels**

|           |                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Level** | **Effect**                                        |
| 1         | Bout of short-term madness (lasts 1d10 minutes)   |
| 2         | Bout of long-term madness (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours) |
| 3         | Bout of indefinite madness (lasts until cured)    |

A creature’s madness level starts at 0. When the creature fails a madness saving throw, its madness level increases by 1, and the creature immediately suffers the level’s effect (as determined by rolling on the Short Term Madness table, the Long-Term Madness table, or the Indefinite Madness table in the Dungeon Master’s Guide). When the effect ends, the creature’s madness level doesn’t change. Any time the creature’s madness level increases, it suffers the effect of the new level.
 
If a creature with level 3 madness fails a madness saving throw, its madness level becomes 1. In this way, characters can potentially accumulate multiple forms of madness.
 
Bouts of short-term and long-term madness can be cured as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Given the demonic source of the madness, remove curse and dispel evil and good are also effective as cures.
 
A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is needed to cure indefinite madness, and also resets a creature’s madness level to 0. Additional information on madness and its effects can be found in specific D&D Adventurers League adventures throughout the Rage of Demons season.

# Curing Madness
A [calm emotions] spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a [lesser restoration] spell can rid a character of a **short-term** or l**ong-term** madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A [greater restoration] spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of **indefinite** madness.

## **Rage of Demons: Rank 3 Downtime Activities** 
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Members of the five factions who have achieved rank 3 have access to the following special downtime activities when adventuring in and around Hillsfar and in the Underdark beneath the city.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Harpers—Mental Fortitude.</strong> You are a Brightcandle of the Harpers. Under the tutelage of your faction-mates in Elventree, you have learned the secrets of healing the mind. If you are afflicted with any type of madness, you can spend one downtime day to reduce your madness level by 1, and to cure any short-term madness or long-term madness that afflicts you. You can do the same for allies, but the cost is three downtime days per ally cured. You cannot use this benefit to cure indefinite madness, and you cannot reduce your madness level to 0 if you are afflicted with indefinite madness.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Emerald Enclave—Madness Ward.</strong> You are an Autumnreaver of the Emerald Enclave, and know that the madness creeping to the surface world from the depths of the Underdark is wholly unnatural. By performing cleansing rituals and warding areas where demonic madness has been seen or felt, you and your companions can bolster your resistance to that madness. For each downtime day you spend, you can grant yourself or an ally a madness ward that lasts until your next long rest. A creature with this madness ward can use a reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw against madness. A character can have only one madness ward active at a time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
