title: Downtime
---

# **BETWEEN ADVENTURES**

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.
 
In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

## **Lifestyle Expenses:**

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.
 
Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.

*\[Adventures typically award 10 downtime days at the end of the episode or adventure unless otherwise specified\]*

Downtime activities and lifestyle maintenance are done when you’re not adventuring. They help to define adventurers outside their normally extraordinary adventures, and can have an impact on how others perceive them. If you want your character to engage in a downtime activity between episodes or adventures, you have the following options available to you. All of these options are found in the Basic Rules or the Player’s Handbook. Crafting. You can craft nonmagical objects. However, D&D Adventurers League play does not support multiple characters combining their downtime days toward the crafting of a single item. Potions of healing (as listed in the Player’s Handbook) are treated as nonmagical objects for the purpose of crafting.

## **Crafting: (Downtime Activity):**

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring [[Trade Goods|equipment]] and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of [[Armour|armour]].
For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:
End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

## **Researching:**
The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumours and gossip from their lips.
When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s [[Aid|aid]]. Once those [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Conditions|conditions]] are met, you learn the information if it is available. 
For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/General Rules/Adventuring/Expenses]]. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

## **Practicing a Profession :**
You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.
If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

## **Training (Downtime Activity):**
You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might allow additional training options.
First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.
The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.
