<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.</p><p> </p><p>Poisons come in the following four types.</p><p> </p><ul><li><blockquote><p><strong>Contact</strong>. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Ingested</strong>. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 5-foot cube.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Injury.</strong> A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
