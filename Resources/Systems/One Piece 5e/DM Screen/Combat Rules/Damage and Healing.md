|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Acid:**        |  The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.                                 |
| **Bludgeoning:** |  Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.                                                               |
| **Cold:**        | The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold-damage.                                 |
| **Fire**:        | Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.                                                                            |
| **Force**:       | Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. |
| **Lightning**:   | A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.                                                                                 |
| **Necrotic**:    | Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.                                                              |
| **Piercing**:    | Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.                                                             |

| **Psychic**:     | Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.                                                                              |
| **Radiant**:     | Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.      |
| **Slashing**:    | Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.                                                                                                  |
| **Thunder:**     | A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the 'thunder wave' spell, deals thunder damage.                                                       |

## **Healing:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a '<strong>Potion of Healing' [ 2d4 + 2]</strong> can remove damage in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p> </p><p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the <strong>revivify</strong> spell has restored it to life.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>


## **Hit Points:**

## **Damage Rolls:**

# **Critical Hits**
## **Player Critical Success / Hit:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit:</p><p> </p><p>When you score a critical hit, <strong>you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together</strong>. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. <strong>If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</strong></p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Critical Failure:**
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, <strong>the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC</strong>.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Describing the Effects of Damage:**

Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.
