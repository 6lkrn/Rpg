## **Hiding:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. <strong>Until you are discovered or you stop hiding</strong>, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p><p> </p><p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties (includes proficiency). If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What Can You See?</strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

| The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, **the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side**. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. **If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends**. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t. |
