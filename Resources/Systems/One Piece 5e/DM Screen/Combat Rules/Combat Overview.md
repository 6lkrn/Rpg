# **The Order of Combat**

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round.

# **Surprise**

If one party manages to sneak up on their opponents (Stealth vs Perception), they gain surprise over the other.
 
The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
 
If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action/reaction until the end of your first turn. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

# **Initiative**

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order, highest roll goes first. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the tied parties can roll a d20 each to determine the order, highest roll going first.
