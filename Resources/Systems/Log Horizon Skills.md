Who ever just does one thing at a time? Not this person! By the way, these are not the TRPG skills, these are the ones from Mamare’s docs. Note that these aren’t all the skills in Elder Tale, just the sample ones.

Sample Builds:
Fortress - The True Shield Role
The standard one-handed sword and large shield style of Guardians in Elder Tale.
Standing at the front of the first raising Hate with <Anchor Howl> and <Taunting Shout> to gather enemies to you, it allows allies to move about the battlefield freely but increases the physical strength of enemies. <Cross Slash> is often used as a basic attack technique.
Damage from enemies is kept to minimum from the high defensive capabilities of the shield, further reinforced by the ability <Shield Mastery> and thick armor, reinforced by <Iron Bounce>. In addition, movement can be sacrificed to increase defense even more with <Fortress Stance> and <Heavy Anchor Stance>, granting great detention capabilities. Of course it is impossible to take hits from the enemies forever, but they can maintain the front with recovery and protection from allies even if they can't kill monsters.
However, you don't just sit there and take attacks. <Shield Smash> also plays an important role, as it can interrupt enemies. Therefore, it is important to know the "attack you can't let happen" and be prepared to interrupt it.

Scarlet Knight - Two-Handed Weapon HP Absorption Style
Build that uses a two-handed weapon with HP absorption effect with no shield, compensating for damage taken using HP absorption attacks. It is famous because the guild master of <D.D.D> "Berserker" Crusty uses this build.
To throw away the shield and use a heavy weapon like a two-handed axe makes it seem like the furthest thing from the standard image of a Guardian. Although <Anchor Howl> and <Taunting Shout> are used to get the attention of the enemy like most Guardians, powerful attack skills <Onslaught> and <Armor Crash> used with high power weapons like an axe, are used alongside with <Iron Bounce>.
Of course, there are more opportunities for you to get hit because of the lack of a shield, it turns the Guardian into a blood-stained being. It is possible to endure attacks from enemy over a long amount of time by utilizing <Scarlet Weapon>'s which are weapons with HP absorb in conjunction with <Resilience>. It is not possible to build for both offense and defense as the recovery strength is dependent to the damage dealt. This build is ideal for heavy weapons with HP absorb, like Crusty's Phantasmal-class weapon, <Demon-Axe of Fresh Blood>.
Needless to say, two-handed weapons are slow, even the <Demon-Axe of Fresh Blood>'s attack speed is quite low. It is necessary to use a lot of normal attacks to continuously recover HP, in addition to using lots of skills that consume MP. When choosing equipment, ones that raise attack speed, give HP absorb and raises defense are preferred. That being said, it is hard to get powerful items that fit those requirements. Among the Guardians, this is the one that is the most dependent on proper equipment.

Juggernaut - Aggressive Skill Rotation
Build with emphasis on continuous usage of skills rather than normal attacks (auto-attack). "Black Sword" Isaac is recognized as the strongest Guardian in Yamato using this build.
It is similar to the Fortress sword-and-shield style, but the major difference is building for the continuous use for skills through equipment and abilities.
<Castle of Stone> is a powerful skill Guardians use to receive no damage for its duration, but it has a 10 minute cooldown so it is not a special ability that can be used often in battle. However in Elder Tale there are many equipment with cooldown reduction effects. Trump cards like <Counter Break> and <Castle of Stone> can be used at higher rates than normal. This build lets your allies attack the enemy full force while you endure.
It also aids in generating Hate, especially if the Guardian uses <Onslaught> generously, target change caused by high damage dealers in the rear can be avoided like this. Needless to say you are in trouble if the enemy is still alive after you've spent all your attacks. Because of this you need a good ally who has the experience to properly judge when to launch the offensive.
Getting equips with abilities like <Cooldown Reduction> and <Convert Damage to MP> can be hard, not the mention the gold and time needed to acquire <Scroll of Proficiency> to raise your skill ranks.
**Attack**
Cross Slash (クロス・スラッシュ)
Pooling your power into your brandished weapon, strike twice in a shape of an X, a starting skill for Guardians. Because this skill can be used regardless of the weapon, many Guardians know and love it.

Taunting Blow (タウンティングブロウ) -- Hate Control Skill
Increase Hate towards yourself while attacking by using large gestures. A basic skill of Guardians who play the True Shield role.

Aura Saber (オーラセイバー)
Murderous fighting spirit. With a weapon (or bare hands for a Monk) radiating with light, pierce through opponents as though they are wearing nothing. Special attack that deals piercing damage and ignores the defense of the target. While it looks flashy, the damage-to-Hate ratio is lower than other skills, so it's not too good at controlling large groups of enemies. However, this is useful against groups of enemies that don't have very tough skins.

Shield Smash (シールドスマッシュ) -- Movement Skill, Shield Skill
Simply beat someone up with your equipped Shield. The damage dealt is not very high, but it has many effects such as disrupting troublesome attacks or the casting of magic spells, and daunting enemies.

Onslaught (オンスロート) -- Two-handed Weapon Skill
Wielding a large, two-handed weapon, carry out a terrible, fierce attack. The damage dealt is the highest of all the Guardian attack skills. If this attack is successful, it can provide bonus effects such as increased attack power. By using a two-handed weapon and this skill, a Guardian can use an aggressive build.

Armor Crash (アーマークラッシュ) -- Heavy Weapon Skill
Using a heavy weapon such as an Axe or Hammer, deal a heavy blow on an opponent's armor and lower their ATK and DEF.

Shield Swing (シールドスウィング) -- Shield Skill, Pushback/Move Attack
Wielding a Shield, rush into an enemy and deal a heavy blow to an opponent. This skill consumes slightly more MP, but has a wider range of effect; if correctly positioned, the user can hit multiple enemies. The damage output of this skill depends on the Shield's defense.

Scarlet Thrust (スカーレットスラスト) -- Spear Skill, Recovery Skill
Special attack that absorbs the physical strength of an opponent that is hit by this skill. The amount absorbed is by no means large, but it is one of the few Recovery skills that Guardians have, so being able to relieve the Healing classes at least a little bit can be a big help. When this skill is successful, a red ball of light appears around the user.
**Defense**
Anchor Howl (アンカー・ハウル) -- Hate Control Skill
Establish yourself as a threat to the enemy by raising a loud cry, a powerful Guardian provocation skill that instantaneously raises your own Hate. Since you are taking the brunt of the enemy's attacks, you gain a DEF boost for a short while, a reason why Guardians are good on the front lines. While defense is increased, the Guardian's armor glows. (TL: This actually doesn't mention the counterattack that Guardians can deal in case an opponent attempts to ignore the taunt.)

Castle of Stone (キャッスル・オブ・ストーン) -- Special Skill
Become the pinnacle of defense, an immobile fortress of stone that can take all damage for a short duration. It is one of the strongest defense skills, exclusive to Guardians. When this skill is in effect, the user's body looks like it is made of marble.

Covering (カバーリング)
Before enemies can get too close, stand in their way to defend another member of your team and take the damage for them, another signature skill of the Guardian class. Because you have to be in position before activating the skill, the party's formation is important.

Counter Break (カウンターブレイク) -- Special Skill
Offset the power of an enemy's attack with your own. There is a popular charm in the flashy effects when an attack is successfully canceled. Because the amount of damage reduced depends on attack power, it is said that a two-handed weapon-wielding Guardian can offset even a Samurai's trump card. Because this skill has a long cooldown time, it is important to have good timing.

Cool Defense (クールディフェンス)
Be a calm and reassuring defense in any situation. Reduce any damage taken by a certain percent during the duration of this skill. The effect increases with the amount of damage taken, but also uses up MP, so most people use it in a short duration of time when under heavy attack.

Fortress Stance (フォートレス・スタンス) -- Toggle-type, Support Skill, Stance
Turn into a weaponless, defense-oriented, steadfast fortress. You cannot be pushed back by or wince at an opponent's attack, and your defense increases. Useful in long, drawn-out battles against multiple opponents. A blue aura manifests at your feet when this skill is in use.

Iron Bounce (アイアンバウンス)
Take the opponent's attack on a strong part of your equipment, reducing the damage. There is a chance that this skill will automatically activate when you are hit. As the proficiency level of this skill increases, the amount of damage taken is further reduced, and the chance of the skill activating automatically increases.

Steady Bulwark (ステディブルワーク) -- Shield Skill, Special Skill
Ready your shield in a defensive pose to reduce damage. A dome-shaped light encases your allies within a certain range, applying the damage reduction effect to them as well. The higher the defense of your shield, the greater the effect of this skill.

Vicarious Shield (ヴァイカリウスシールド) -- Revival, Shield Skill, Special Skill
Prevent a fatal blow at the expense of your shield. The moment your HP drops to 0, a portion of your HP will be instantly restored. Because the shield you used will be destroyed, it is necessary to prepare a spare two-handed weapon or shield to replace it. This will not work against a barrage of attacks (since you only get revived once per shield), and repairing a shield after it was destroyed can be costly.

Shield Mastery (シールドマスタリー) -- Passive Skill, Shield Skill
Increase the defense of whatever shield you equip. Different levels of this skill will also provide bonus benefits that further enhances the defensive capabilities of your shield.

Heavy Anchor Stance (ヘヴィアンカー・スタンス) -- Toggle-type, Movement Skill, Support Skill, Stance
Stick close to an opponent, preventing them from moving away from you. However, you have to be careful of pushback skills that could disrupt this stance. When this skill is in effect, there is a dull chain between you and your target.
**Other**
Resilience (レジリアンス) -- Recovery Skill
Showing the durability of a Guardian's strong body, recover HP during battle as if you were resting. HP is gradually recovered, but not at the rate of a Druid's heal-over-time spells. It is useful for continuing long battles, though.

Taunting Shout (タウンティング・シャウト) -- Hate Control Skill
Basic provocation skill that targets one opponent and directs the attention towards you. With this, your allies can attack without worry of becoming targeted. When this skill is used, there is an air wave effect around you as you raise a loud cry.

Step Over (ステップオーバー)
If there is a trap, you can break it by force and take damage in return. If it is successful, the trap will then be disabled for a period of time, and your allies can pass through safely.
 


//==Samurai==\\

Sample Builds:
Sword Samurai - Standard Katana Samurai
It can be said that this build and style is a popular class in Elder Tale as a faithful aggressive front-line guard, with its two-handed katana and Samurai-themed armor.
After getting the attention of the enemy using <Samurai's Challenge>, getting first hit by using <Kabuto-Wari> which increases first hit damage, lowering the enemy's resistance. The standard strategy is to use <Kodama Kaeshi> to increase your damage output with counterattacks.
Needless to say, you will die immediately if it keeps up. Damage can be offset by using <Parry> and <Kirikaeshi> but when you take their cooldown into consideration, you will need to use <Setsuna no Mikiri> and <Murakumo no Tachi> to avoid attacks. In a situation where a strong enemy appears, using <Ikkikasei> to reset your timers is a valid option for continuous defense. It takes an experienced player to know when and where to use this trump card.
Two-handed grip is the basic style, but some dual-wield as a second choice. A katana held in one hand loses power in comparison to one held in two hands, but it is compensated by the fencing style of having a sword in each hand. Because the dual-wield style increases the number of hits the overall damage has a chance to be increase, due to the fact that abilities on the swords will have more chances to activate. <Shunsen> can increase the number of moves used by increasing attack speed. A problem is that you must prepare enough funds, as repair costs are doubled and you have to get multiple weapons.

Vengeance - Iai Style Counter
A build that focus' on the positioning and static movement of the Samurai. Although you hold the katana with two hands, the power comes from using abilities specializing in counterattacks.
<Iai no Kamae> is the focal point of the build. It is used as a bare-handed skill. The Iai opening motion turns it into a sword attack, increasing both the power and hit rate greatly. <Denkosekka> can be used in combination to increase attack speed and prevent flinching, <Go no Sen> and <Kodama Kaeshi> allows for the enemy to attack first, letting you unleash automatic rapid strong counterattacks.
You will always be in a counterattack posture in this mode, ready to be activated again even after killing the enemies, due to this there is a certain stiffness. The disadvantage is that this makes it hard to react quickly to sudden situations.
Alternatively you can use two swords. <Kodama Kaeshi> will only use the main sword, in which case the second one is used for continuous defense. It is also possible to attack like this.
Soujiro of <West Wind Brigade> uses this build, but aren't many players who use this because the difficulty is high and they lack the proper equipment.
**Attack**
Kabuto-wari 
Charge at the enemy from the front and swing your weapon straight down the center, aiming for the opponent’s head. Because the first attack on a monster gains bonus damage, many use this skill to initiate combat. It has a wide range in the front due to the attack motion. This is also the reason why beginner Samurai immediately charge in using this skill.

Mozu no Hayanie/Lanias Capture -- Two-handed Weapon Skill
Dive in to thrust at the enemy's head, throat, then entire body. Damage is mild, but the skill temporarily interrupts the enemy's chanting or spellcasting, so it is effective against magic users. However, the skill range is short.

Kasha no Tachi
Named after the ghoul in the Yamato legends that sent the dead to the afterworld. Imbues weapon with strong desire to defeat enemy and, as if drawing the a circle around the enemy, attacks with continuous strikes. When against multiple enemies, it can be used to split up enemies or as a hate skill. When against a single enemy, it can deal massive damage.

Koko Yaburi -- Heavy Weapon (Axe/Hammer) Skill
Strike as if to break down walls or gates, a sudden intense heavy attack. It is not just a simple direct attack, but also collectively blows away all nearby enemies and Stuns them. Samurai use this skill to open up a breakthrough, allowing allies to rush in. Has the potential to completely destroy enemy formation, especially powerful in team fights. In raids, Samurai using heavy weapons like axes or hammers are also fairly common.

Kaburaya -- Hate Skill, Bows-Only
Fires off with a loud sound, provoking and attacking the enemy at the same time. Can be used to attract enemies to your position. Effectiveness as a hate skill is not bad, but few Samurai main bows so this is an unpopular skill.
**Support**
Shunsen/Fast Break -- Attack Skill
Launches a swift attack. Temporarily increases attack speed, shortens interval between attacks, makes continuous strikes possible. DPS increases as enemy numbers increase.

Suzaku no Kamae/Assault Stance -- Toggle-type
Takes an offensive stance with a roar. When in effect, gains red aura and offensive power increases dramatically but evasion ability decreases just as much. Used for short-term battles to defeat weaker opponents in as little time as possible.

Go no Sen
Intentionally allow enemy to have the initiative to allow yourself to take advantage of a flaw in the opponent's attack, then launch a continuous counterattack. Samurai who use this skill take the interception stance. Samurai in interception mode will automatically counterattack. "Iai Stance" and such counterattack skills can also be used in conjunction with this skill, counter builds with a combination of these counterattacks are staple battle tactics of Samurai.

Ukifune Watari -- Movement Skill
A skill that allows a Samurai's footwork to mimic a boat that floats on surface of water. While in use, feet move as though sliding. Movement speed does not actually change. Since this skill increases accuracy rate, Samurai use it against enemies with high evasion rate or as preparation before repeating a large skill you don't want to give up. Even when in close contact with enemy, Samurai can use to “Ukifune Backstep,” which is a common practice of Samurai players.

Iai Stance -- Toggle-type, Stance
Can be turned on or off at will for the situation. Samurai, barehanded without a weapon, holds the Iai stance. While in effect, can draw the Iai, an extremely powerful and hard-to-evade attack, however due to "Stance→Attack" being 2 required motions, the attack is slightly delayed. The Samurai makes the stance his base and focuses on the power of a single strike rather than multiple strikes. The "Iai build" is one of the typical Samurai builds. While in effect, blue aura covers whole body. Just by looking, you can tell in PVP is completely meaningless. Samurai who have obtained Phantasmal-tier katana which are capable of long range attacks ruin the chastity of PVP.

Samurai’s Challenge -- Hate Skill
Brandish weapon, declare one's name and such actions causes target to lose temper, provocation technique that encourages enemies to attack the user. Range is inferior to Guardian's hate skills, but makes up for it by absorbing hate from ally into self. This property gives allies the chance to use stronger techniques.

Kodama Kaeshi -- Hate skill
When hit by an opponent's attack the Samurai automatically counters, with the accuracy rate depending on proficiency level. Elimination rate increases as enemy numbers increase although hate incurred from the damage of the counter also offsets hate agitation. The ability to maintain hate is very valuable. After the Apocalypse, Samurai would automatically activate this skill in a state of tension. "I caught a fly with chopsticks", "Before the leaf fell to the ground I cut it into 7 parts" and such reports exist.

**Defense**
Parry/Cool Defense
Calm and firm defense regardless what the situation is. While in effect, cuts a percentage of damage received. Percentage increases as damage received increases. Continuous MP cost over time. Typically used over a short period of time to tank a high-damage attack.

Denkosekka/Lightning Speed -- Offensive/Defensive Support Skill
Self-reinforcement skill that increases own movement speed. In addition, when receiving an enemy attack, the Samurai can activate then cancel in a rigid time frame, and gains what is commonly called “Super Armor.” During this effect, entire body wrapped in a lightning sparks aura. An all-in maximum-speed straight-charge attack enhances damage and hate. The beautiful aura is nice but this skill leaves behind the team and is considered bad teamwork and looked down upon in parties. Samurai who spam "Helm Splitter" and "Lightning Speed" are called "Pig Samurai", "Explosive Sam" etc.


Special skills
Ittoryodan
(Cut in Two)
Literally cuts enemy in half by letting out one extremely intense attack. Capable of dealing a large amount of damage. Cooldown one use a day. Only a single hit with a moment of explosive DPS, cannot continuously deal out large amounts of damage like the Assassin.
Kirikaeshi
(Returning Slash)
[Counter Break]
Can offset the power of attacks aimed at myself, by landing my own hit. If offsetting is successful, weapon gains a shining effect. This skill is also popular for looking fancy. Amount of damage that can be reduced depends on attack power so for offensive Samurai, this skill can be called a trump card. Because it has a long cooldown and cannot be used in succession, there is technical aspect of the user's skill.
Setsuna no Mikiri
(A Moment's Jettison)
Can completely avoid any and all attacks, evasion success rate occurs in a flash. Extremely short time of effect, starts at 2 seconds and with the utmost training can reach 8 seconds. While active, can reach 100% evasion rate, becomes practically invincible during this duration. This is essentially the Samurai's version of the Guardian Skill "Castle of Stone".
Murakamo no Tachi
(Murakamo's Tachi)
Katana skill. Just like the legend of Ame no Murakamo who extinguished a burning wildfire with a single swing, the Samurai cancels attacks by slicing and cutting through each attack. Extremely short duration but enemy's attacks are completely nullified. Thanks to the long range of Murakamo no Tachi, it not only protects the Samurai, but covers allies as well. Sometimes this skill will make or break a raid boss fight.
Ikkikasei
(In One Breath)
Auxiliary skill. Allows Samurai to use any skill and ignores cooldown. Duration is exceptionally short but still possible to mount a continuous barrage of powerful attacks. However this skill expends many resources at once, "In One Breath" itself consumes over 3000 MP and other skills MP costs are increased. This skill is a double-edged sword where slightly improper timing will instantly deplete all resources for nothing.



Miscellaneous skills
Zentetsuken
(Steel-Cutting Sword)
Is described to destroy doors, obstacles, and other such breakable objects with one strike.



//==Monk==\\
Link: http://ncode.syosetu.com/n5313bu/7/
**Attack**
Lightning Straight (ライトニング・ストレート)
Bluish-white lightning envelops your fist as you punch the enemy. Because it deals lightning magic damage, it is effective against enemies with high physical defense with tough armor and skin. While Elder Tale was a game, you used a straight punch when you activated this skill. After the Catastrophe, though, you can use this skill with any kind of punch.

Wyvern Kick (ワイバーンキック)
Flying Dragon Kick [TL: Karate move]. A powerful jumping kick. The distance covered with this move is long and makes you almost like a missile. The wide area covered also makes it a good movement skill.

Shadowless Kick (シャドウレスキック)
A Hung Gar technique of the same name. After you succeed in evading an attack, you have a fixed chance of performing an automatic counterattack. Against a weak opponent, aside from damage, you have a chance of dealing instant death. A super-high-speed counterattack won't even leave an afterimage, and you can only be heard after it's too late. The probability of this skill being performed increases as the level gap increases (with the enemies being increasingly weaker), so many Monks will use it to clean up low-level mob-cleaning quests. It might accidentally get you killed when you are trying to flee because you automatically counterattack into a mob of enemies.

Tiger Echo Fist (タイガーエコーフィスト)
A powerful punch that sends an oscillation into the target, destroying it both externally and internally. The more damage you deal with your punch, the longer the oscillation is in effect. After several seconds, it explodes, and deals more damage between the time that you punch and the time that it explodes. Because this skill also weakens the opponent's defense while the oscillations continue, it is often used as the first strike.

Aura Saber (オーラセイバー)
Cut an opponent with your weapon or fist surrounded by a glowing aura. This special attack technique deals piercing damage that ignores enemy defense. However, the actual damage dealt even after ignoring defense and the amount of Hate you gain aren't particularly high. Even so, this skill is handy against monsters and spirits that don't have high defense. It's a common Warrior skill, but can be a Monk's most often-used one.

Dragon Tail Swing (ドラゴンテイルスウィング) --

Hunting Hawk (ハンティングホーク) -- Movement Skill, Throwing Weapons-Only

Orion Delay Blow (オリオンディレイブロウ) -- Special Skill
Three-point touch of death. Randomly fire innumerable punches into the shape of the Orion constellation. The shockwave after the constellation is completed can be devastating over time.

Aerial Rave (エアリアルレイブ) -- Attack Support

Beat Up (ビートアップ) -- Attack Support
Raise morale by and brag over beating up your opponents. At a certain probability, temporarily raise Attack Speed and Power after defeating an enemy. If the technique is successful, you appear as though fire is surrounding your body. This technique tends to draw Hate when successful.

Tiger Stance (タイガー・スタンス) -- Attack Support, Toggle-type, Stance
Can be toggled on and off at will. Raise a cry and take on an attack stance. Evasion drops in exchange for high Attack power, so this is usually used during short battles where you want to finish off the opponents quickly. A translucent tiger appears overhead and a red aura appears at your feet when this skill is in use. Because Evasion is the lifeline of a Monk, using this technique uses quite a bit of courage.

Grizzly Slam (グリズリースラム) --

Silent Palm (サイレントパーム) -- Movement Inhibition

Turning Swallow (ターニングスワロー) --

Dual Fist (デュアルフィスト)
	Attack the enemy while alternating fists.

Triple Blow (トリプルブロウ)

Backhand (バックハンド)

Mantis Action (マンティスアクション)
 **Defense**
Long-Range Cover (ロングレンジカバー) --

Hard Body (ハードボディ) --

Iron Rhino Stance (アイアンリノ・スタンス) -- Defense Support, Toggle-type, Stance
Can be toggled on or off at will. Lower your Evasion in exchange for high Defense. During this time, damage taken is reduced by a fixed amount, but Evasion and Movement Speed drops sharply. When this skill is in effect, a rhinoceros appears around the player and a reddish-black aura radiates from their body.

Covering (カバーリング) -- Defense Support(?)
Shares the damage taken by nearby allies. Because Monks have higher elemental resistance and HP than other tanks, it is good for keeping the front-line defense up.

Amber Elephant Stance (アンバーエレファント・スタンス) -- Defense Support, Stance
	Protect an ally by taking up a stance where you constantly stand in an enemy’s way.

Daunting Pose (ドーンティングポーズ)

Dragon Scale Stance (ドラゴンスケイル・スタンス) -- Stance
	Raises your resistance to Fire and Ice attacks.
**Other**
Rafting Taunt (ラフティングタウント) -- Hate Control
Phantom Step (ファントムステップ) -- Movement Skill
Resilience (レジリアンス) -- Recovery Support Skill
Indomitable (インドミタブル) -- Recovery Skill, Special Skill, Revival
Monkey Step (モンキーステップ) -- Hate Control, Movement Skill
Breath Control (ブレスコントロール) -- Recovery Skill

Drunk Monkey (ドランクモンキー) -- Support
A self-reinforcement skill that consumes one drink and gives you the abnormal Drunk status. Boosts your attack a little bit. When used in conjunction with the <Drunken Master> subclass, you can gain extra bonuses and skills.

Adhesion Bee (アドヒュージョンビー) --

Kung Fu Action (カンフーアクション) -- Movement Skill

Soul Infusion (ソウルインフュージョン) --

Taunting Shout (タウンティングシャウト) -- Hate Control

Drag Move (ドラッグムーブ) -- Hate Control

Martial Arts (マーシャルアーツ) -- Support

Lynx Tumbling (リンクスタンブリング)
	Raises your Evasion rate.

Wildcat Stance (ワイルドキャット・スタンス) -- Support, Stance
Increases your movement speed and attack speed, allowing you to make consecutive attacks.


//==Cleric==\\

Sample Builds:
Armor Cleric - Heavy Armored Type
Wearing plate armor and shields, wielding weapons like maces and swords, this "Combat Priest" is common.
At first glance it may seem dangerous for a Cleric to fight on the front lines, but if the frontliners near them are the ones who require recovery frequently, they can support appropriately from that location. This is due to the limited range of the magic, it will not work if you are not at the front.
Also, by contributing in dealing damage, the time it takes to kill a monster is lowered, reducing the damage taken by the party.
Many "Combat Priest" place great importance in self-reinforcement and skills such as <Divine Might>, <Holy Shield>, <Holy Hit> and <Faithful Blade>. Above all, <Healing Forge> is an excellent skill that serves as an attack for enemies and recovery for allies, it is known as a classic "Combat Priest" skill.
Needless to say, <Reactive Heal> is important to "Combat Priest" as well. The party can concentrate on fighting with no worries so long as the "Combat Priest" is still standing and fighting, while using their self-recovery. In addition, this build is popular even among solo players because it has good balance between attack skills and recovery skills.
Coppelia of Gaiden uses this Armor Cleric build. She uses a shield in each hand, creating a dual-shield build, it is highly effective with <Holy Shield>'s assault attack and her recovery.

High Healer - Centralized Healing
A build that supports allies and friends from the rear, away from the monsters, with magical attacks and recovery spells. They are referred to as "Healing Hands, Ruby: High Healer"
There are some that wear shields and plate armor, but most of the time they wear robes, which are better at reinforcing the effects of recovery magic. For weapons, they mostly carry canes and the like with support capabilities rather than weapons with high offensive magical power.
The strong point of "Healing Hands" is its high level of support. Occasionally launching long distance attacks with <Judgment Ray>, covering allies with <Reactive Heal> while holding the front with <Energy Protection> and <Sacred Wall>. The reason why they can concentrate on supporting allies like this is because they are in a safe position in the back.
Recovery specialists are always in high demand, even among Clerics, so a highly skilled healer is welcome in any guild. Because of this build that favors allies, it seems that they are trusted a lot.
The advantage of this over Armor Cleric is that you're not in close range with monsters. Also, the lighter armor for recovery classes increases maximum MP by a large value (compared to heavy armor at the same rank that increases max HP). Robe Clerics are proud of their higher MP compared to the Armor Clerics, and their higher MP allows them to outperform Armor Clerics in longer battles.
Maryelle of <Crescent Moon Alliance> uses this build.

Restoration magic
Reactive Heal
[Reactive Activation Recovery] The Cleric's starting restorative skill and regarded as the Cleric's signature skill. Unlike Heal that immediately restores hit points at once, Reactive Heal requires the target to receive damage to trigger this skill's effect. Reactive Heal's effectiveness in combat relies on the caster's level and the level of the skill itself, but it does not require the Cleric to focus on a single ally like in Heal, allowing the "Heal Walk" tactic to be employed. When activated, the ally becomes wrapped with a warm orange light as a visual effect.
Heal
The most fundamental HP recovery magic of the Cleric and the root of all restorative skills of the Cleric. Although it grants a very high amount of HP, it is known for its long casting time and poor mana efficiency compared to other healing skills, barrier skills and reactive activation skills, thus putting this on low priority amongst Cleric skills. Beginners often look at Clerics based on how much HP this skill heals, causing some to be called second-rate or third-rate healers. That said, truly useless healers are out of the question, since most healers are at least competent in using restorative magic. When this skill is used, the caster is surrounded by a hazy warm light, and the chosen target is showered down with particles of light.
Cure
A basic cure magic that removes negative status effects from a single ally. It consumes little MP and has the ability to remove negative status effects regardless of type, but higher skill ranks allow shorter casting times for this skill. Its effect is a pale blue light similar to that of Heal. The effectiveness of its cure effect may vary based on the level of the skill and the gap between the level of the user and the level of the monster which gave the status effect.
Healing Light
Heals injuries by shooting a white light with a hexagram shape from one's fingertips. The amount of HP it heals is small compared to Heal, but it generates minimal Hate and only consumes a small amount of MP, as well as having short casting and cooldown times. It can be used to heal minor wounds and emergency healing, and is often used alongside primary restoration spells to supplement one's healing capabilities. In large-scale battles where many Clerics are organized, Healing Light can be "showered" on a single tank. Because of its utility, players regardless of level are dependent on the use of this skill. Among its popular nicknames are "Do Your Best Heal" and "Crossroad Heal".
Reactive Area Heal
[Reactive Activation Recovery] A reactive activation recovery skill that instantly heals allies within an area. Like Reactive Heal, it requires allies to receive damage to activate. While useful in battle, its long cooldown prevents the user from using it in quick succession. Its appearance is similar to that of Reactive Heal.
Resurrection
[Resurrection] A fundamental resurrection magic for low level healing classes. A Player is transported to a nearby Cathedral when its HP becomes 0, but can be revived before this could happen. Resurrection has a long casting time, consumes a lot of MP, and the target must not make contact with anything else during casting, making this skill very difficult to use during combat. Aside from this, it shares cooldown times with superior resurrection skills, narrowing down its usefulness in battle even more, causing many players to refrain from using this skill.
Soul Revive
[Resurrection] The Cleric's superior resurrection magic skill. It resembles the fundamental skill Resurrection, but has a quicker casting time and a longer range. Also, it recovers HP over time, making it an indispensable skill to use in combat. One could say that it is required in rebuilding the collapsing war fronts in battle. Higher skill levels for Soul Revive decreases cooldown times, so raiding players often rely on many Clerics with Esoteric Skill Scrolls to increase the chances of reviving. For this reason, the demand of Esoteric Skill Scrolls is in a steep climb.
Aurora Heal
[Special] The most powerful area restoration skill of the Cleric, boasting a range that exceeds that of normal Area Heal. When cast, it covers the effective area with the seven colors of the rainbow, similar to an aurora. It has demonstrated its effectiveness on raids by healing dozens of units at a time, but its ability to generate Hate makes it a risky skill to use in combat. Clerics consider this skill to be their trump card, but cannot be used every time due to its long cooldown. Aside from this, the Cleric must know how proper positioning to bring the true potential of this skill.
Divine Favor
A skill that temporarily removes all negative status effects on the user. Take note that this does not remove one's negative status effects, and can be called "damage postponement" of sorts. Although Clerics have the ability to clear oneself of all negative status effects in battle, it may put the rest of the party in imminent danger. It is for this reason that this skill is important for Clerics, particularly healers. Take note that this skill only affects status effects that are active on the user at the time of casting.
Healing Forge
[Attack Skill - Restoration Skill] A skill that releases a soothing magic on allies and attacks enemies at the same time. When hitting enemies using one's weapon, light green rings emanate from it, granting a minor heal on allies that make contact with those rings. This skill is part of the Battle Cleric Build, which uses mostly battle-type skills and offensive skills, and is popular for being relatively easy to use. It is also widely used by Solo Battle Clerics who want to attack and heal at the same time. One disadvantage of this skill is that its healing value is unchanged regardless of damage received, and can be untrustworthy in some occasions. Also, its healing can be considered as insignificant compared to other healing skills. This, however, can be boosted by increasing one's attack speed, so using weapons that has this effect is necessary. When this skill is active, each hit makes a clear sound like a hammer on metal.



Offensive magic
Holy Light
A single-target skill that fires a vengeful ray of white light from one's palms or weapon, dealing damage of Holy property to an enemy. Monsters of Shadow property will be dealt defense-piercing damage. This skill is the fundamental offensive skill of the Cleric, and possesses an average and balanced efficiency. It is available in early levels, but it loses its usefulness at higher levels. Some high-tier items can strengthen the effectiveness of Holy Light, and builds that focus on Holy Light are popular amongst Clerics.
Judgment Ray
[Special] Gathers a holy light from within and unleashes it as a ray of Holy property magic. It deals exceptionally high damage and has the appearance of a shimmering laser beam that toasts enemies in its path, making it the appropriate one-hit kill ability of the Cleric. The beam's direction can be changed and can hit up to 2-3 enemies this way, allowing players to use the "lulling sweep" technique to eliminate enemies. Another thing of note is that this skill only hits enemies, so ally players within the path of the Judgment Ray are unharmed. On the other hand, using this skill is severely taxing to one's mana, so it is considered to be a very impractical skill to use in raids in other aspects of combat.
Holy Hit
[Support] One's weapon is momentarily basked in magic, improving the accuracy of consecutive attacks using that weapon. Requires a short casting duration and needs the Cleric to raise the weapon above his head to invoke this skill, and is the type that is used in between other actions or skills. Along with its low cost and lack of a dramatic effect, it easily mixes well with other offensive skills.
Argent Chaîne
[Status Infliction Attack] Wraps a target enemy with a dazzling silver light that inflicts damage of Holy property. It is known for its exceptional visual effect, and its appearance is popular among players. Although it inflicts low damage, it has the ability to blind an enemy and lower its accuracy within its duration. This skill is also called "Holy Blinding Sand" and "I can see the goddess! My eyes! My eyes!" among other things.



Physical techniques
Faithful Blade
[Sword-Only Skill] Unleashes a slashing attack empowered by the words of the Scriptures. In the original game, when this skill is used, the user assumes a stance as if accumulating one's energy, and one's weapon is covered by a silver aura depending on the user's charge time. When released, it deals damage and consumes MP depending on the amount of charge time. At its highest level, it can kill enemies in one hit using a maximum charge, but due to the varying aspects of real combat, this is a rare feat, so it is important to judge well the usage of this skill. To most people, knowing how to regulate the damage of this skill is a commendable feat in itself. On the other hand, there are some romantic players who take risks to pull off that impossible one-hit kill. In the original game, the "charging animation" for Faithful Blade consists of doing a low squat and stirring one's body about. After the Apocalypse, it seems that only very few people do this action.
Divine Might
[Support Skill] A self-buff that converts healing power into destructive might. Instantaneously increases one's attack power depending on the amount of healing power of the restorative skill used at the moment of casting. The user's weapon and palms glow with the same color as of the restorative skill they used.
Holy Shield
[Passive - Shield-Only Skill] One's shield glows as bright as the sun and strikes the enemy. Attack power is low, but gives consistent damage that ignores enemy defense. Holy Shield's base damage is based on the equipped shield's magic defense, so rare shields found in raids are recommended for this skill. Its glaring weakness is that this skill only triggers on melee-range attacks.



Defensive magic
Devotion
Swaps with an ally that will be dealt damage and intercepts it with an equipped shield, protecting the targeted ally in exchange for receiving 100% of the damage (with none of the negative status effects to be received) to be dealt to that ally. Devotion is known to be a dangerous skill to misuse as it puts the user in direct confrontation with an enemy when used.
Sanctuary
[Support Magic] A magic square spreads out from the caster, transforming the surrounding area into sacred ground. Allies that step inside this zone are blessed with increased physical and magical defense. In order to maintain this zone, the caster is prohibited from moving away from the point of activation. For this reason, setting up Sanctuary requires careful planning of battle formations beforehand.
Sacred Wall
[Special] Creates a dome of white light on a chosen ally, diminishing incoming damage towards that ally. The degree of protection given by the skill is dependent on the user's magical power, so equipment that boosts magical attack is necessary. It is one of the skills that has a long reuse control time to prevent skill abuse.
Energy Protection
A powerful aura-type support skill that creates an area that decreases damage received by allies from a single property. The aura changes color according to the chosen property (red for Fire, blue for Water, etc.). The aura lasts for up to five minutes, and the current status of the aura is updated at fixed intervals throughout the party. Aside from the boosts it can give in combat, it also has some practical uses, particularly in laying traps and navigating through terrain.



Special skills
Ethereal Chant
(Angel's Whisper)
[Offensive Magic - Restoration Magic - Special] The Cleric mutters a prayer, followed by the appearance of bright sparkling feathers falling from the heavens. These feathers damage the Cleric's opponents and heals allies. This kind of offense-defense skill is a powerful kind of magic and is best used while in melee range, but deals a heavy cost on the user and has a long cooldown.
Parabellum
[Miscellaneous Magic - Support Magic - Special] Restores a target's mind and body to its optimum. The target's cooldowns would be accelerated by 20%-100%. Although a powerful skill, it can only be used once a day (cooldown lasts for 24 hours). When cast, it has the appearance of an orange light emanating from the user.
Heaven's Law
[Defensive Magic - Special] Summons a rain of bright energy from the heavens that counterbalances an enemy's might, weakening its offensive capabilities. Also works on boss monsters. Its drawbacks include a long cooldown time, and the short duration of this skill's effect. When using this skill, pillars of light descend from the heavens, pinning down the enemy while chains of red light entwine around the target.
Symbol of Sacrament
[Defensive Magic - Special] Calls forth a complex formation made out of light beneath the user's feet, signifying the miracle of protection. The pattern vanishes into particles of light that surround nearby allies, protecting their mind and body from certain harm. Compared to its effective time of three minutes, its cooldown of 24 hours is exceedingly long, but its ability to render the party immune to negative status effects more than makes up for it.
Graceful Garden
[Restoration Support Magic - Toggle Type] Constructs a round barrier made up of golden light around the user, dramatically amplifying the healing effects of Reactive Heal on nearby allies. The skill can be activated and deactivated, but its effect automatically ends when an offensive skill or a magic skill is used. When Graceful Garden was added during the release of the expansion pack, it's boosting effect was the pride of many, and many parties in obstacle quests employed the effects of this skill, causing it to be later weakened (nerfed), but not after some players are ridiculed for being "Healbot Gardens". Very few now use this skill in the game.


Miscellaneous skills
Bug's Light
[Support Magic - Summoning] A kind of illumination magic that can be learned by all healing classes. Summons Bug's Lights, a firefly-like familiar, to illuminate the surrounding area. This familiar summoning skill gives a very simplistic effect that it seems impossible to control the intensity of light it gives, etc.

Sample Builds:
Witch Doctor - Recovery Support Type
Druids specialize in regeneration/Heal over Time
The main HoT spell is Heartbeat Healing. Rotates multiple healing spells, as well as instant heals if needed.
Both Serara and Mikakage use this build; however, Serara isn’t a pure Witch Doctor, since Minori is also there to support, so she uses quite a bit of her Attack and Summon skills.

Shaman - Attack Magic Type
Although a healer class, they do have some powerful offensive spells.
"Call Storm" debuffs the field lowering elemental resistance, and offensive spells "Lightning Fall", "Hail Wind", "Icicle Ripper" deal damage.
Essentially a second-rate sorcerer that can also heal.

Absorber - Continuous MP Recovery Attack Type
Melee build.
Using MP absorption weapons, you melee the enemy, recover MP and use melee skills such as Burning Bite and Fierce Maul. Use the gained MP for healing as well.
Also uses pets such as Gray Wolf, Forest Bear, and Wild Boar. On top of attacking, they can knockdown or knock back enemies to aid.
Silver Sword's Vuorinen uses this build.
**Recovery**
Heartbeat Healing (ハートビートヒーリング) -- Healing over Time
A skill special to Druids, use the forces of nature to heal a target over time. While this skill is in effect, there is a pulsating green glow around the target when HP is recovered. It lasts 70 seconds after being used once, so you can use that time to use another Healing skill or a Special Attack.

Gaiabeat Healing (ガイアビートヒーリング) -- Healing over Time
High-level magic with a wider range, allowing you to apply a HoT spell to multiple allies. Each ally that is under the effect of this skill is surrounded by a green glow like in <Heartbeat Healing>. Its effect is powerful and has a long cooldown, but that time can be shortened by raising its skill level. However, it is necessary to be cautious about using this spell because it can attract a lot of Hate. When you use this skill, it is said that you can hear the whispers of the earth.

Cure Bloom (キュアブルーム)

Life Burst (ライフバースト) -- Healing over Time, Special Magic
Greatly increase the effect of your HoT skills to recover a significant amount of HP. It restores the same amount of HP as Heartbeat Healing would, except in a shorter amount of time. It is good in emergencies, but 

Heal (ヒール)
The most basic HP recovery spell acquired by all recovery classes at lower levels. Although it grants a very high amount of HP, it is known for its long casting time and poor mana efficiency compared to other healing skills, barrier skills and reactive activation skills. Beginners have a tendency to rely on this spell heavily due to the high amount of recovery, so healers that frequently use this are judged to be second-rate or third-rate healers. Nevertheless, a healer who does not use it at all is out of the question; the capability of the healer is determined by their ability to know the appropriate time to use this spell. When this spell is used, the caster is surrounded by a hazy warm light, and the chosen target is showered down with particles of light.

**Attack**
Earthquake -- [Attack Magic - Special Magic]
Call Storm -- [Attack Magic - Attack Assistance Magic - Special Magic]
Lightning Fall -- [Attack Magic]

Fierce Mold -- [Attack Technique - Abnormal State]
Although at a glance it appears to be a simple weapon attack, like it says in the name "Fierce Mold", it causes corrosive mold to spring forth from where the opponent was hit on the body, reducing defense considerably. Needless to say, it is effective against enemies with high defense. Due to the visuals of the skill, it tops the list of "Attacks Adventurers don't want to get hit by" after the <Catastrophe> (especially for females).

Burning Bite -- [Attack Technique]
Weapon attack with a with an effect that looks like a flaming jaw biting, it is a fire attribute attack skill. Many vanguard Druids use this skill due to its good balance in MP cost and hate generation. It deals more damage to enemies afflicted by bad status', so it is used in many combos. It is known by it's nickname "Gau gau" due to the beast-like roaring sound (like a wolf) when it hits the target.

Icicle Ripper -- [Attack Magic]
Attack magic that fires many fragments of ice, dealing cold damage to enemies in an area. The fragments of ice whirls around the enemy and tears them up, there's a chance the enemy will instantly die if their level is significantly lower than the caster. It is easy for Druids to use and is effective in long range. It is probably the height of Druid’s basic performance, as many beginners use it to steamroll through battles, but in reality the intermediate levels are embarrassed to call it that.

//==Kannagi==\\

Sample Builds:
Prayer Shrine Maiden/Priest - Defensive Barrier Type
Support build, focuses on damage prevention, mixed with offensive spells.

War Shrine Maiden/Priest - Weapon Attack type
Offensive Melee Build War Priest/Maiden is a Kannagi build that charges into the battlefield and fights up close up. The combination of Naginata or Katana with Japanese clothing is a gorgeous sight and is popular with both males and females.
With only chain armor and low HP, a Kannagi on frontlines is risky,. This is remedied by using "Damage Interception" on herself. A relatively safer way of attacking is to cast "Barrier of Purification" then "Secret Technique of Heaven's Foot Style" to raise movement speed and attack using hit-and-run tactics.
Kannagi offensive weapon skills named "Evil Exorcism" are the strongest of the Healer classes, 100% worth the risk. "Evil Exorcism of the White Snake": self-cast a barrier while attacking , "Evil Exorcism of the Dog God": upon landing a hit the target is afflicted with a status effect and the War Priest/Maiden gains a buff. This is the core of many character's styles. War Priest/Maiden also has many movement spells, such as "Art of Flying Plum" which is good for escaping dangerous situations. The movement spells are very fitting for the War Priest/Maiden build.
Prayer is the mainstream Kannagi build and has the healing power required for PT or raids but as a solo there is stress tends to accumulate due to not having enough attack power.
An offensive melee build means less "Damage Interception" for allies. War Priest/Maiden's fighting style is described by "Get them before they get me". War Priest/Maiden does not aim to take no damage at all with a stalwart defense, but rather to exchange a certain amount of HP in order to defeat opponent in as little time as possible by completely focusing one target.

Bow Shrine Maiden/Priest - Ranged Weapon/Magic Style
Built much like the melee built, since the "exorcism" school of weapon skill also work on bows, but with less emphasis on movement skill and instead upon up for more support, with skills like Kan'no of Swords used for clearing group of mobs to add flexibility.
A balanced build between pure war shaman and barrier shaman. also have the benefit that they can preserver mp and still help with damage dealing, possible combined with weapon effect like mp absorption.

**Damage Interception**

Purification Barrier -- Defensive Skill
A Kannagi's basic defensive skill that intercepts incoming damage. When invoked, summons a mirror-like light blue barrier on an ally. The summoned barrier has a fixed amount of durability that depletes whenever the ally is about to receive damage in exchange for complete protection of that ally. The barrier is destroyed when its durability becomes 0.

In battle where situations are difficult to foresee, Kannagi becomes a disadvantaged class among the three healing classes. However, the Cleric's Reactive Real and the Druid's Pulsing Heal both require the reception of damage to activate. Kannagi, on the other hand, has the ability to nullify incoming damage and prevent any related debuffs to affect a chosen ally. Also, during the Catastrophe, this skill receives an additional effect: the ability to reduce the pain received when injured, causing the demand for Kannagi to rise up after the Catastrophe.

Some people now use the barrier effect of this skill in creative ways, arranging barriers in various ways and even "drawing" using them.

Dispelling Barrier -- Defensive Magic
A high-level magic that creates a large barrier that can protect multiple allies in an area from incoming damage. The effect received by allies is similar to that of the Purification Barrier skill. Unsurprisingly, this powerful skill consumes a lot of MP and has a long reuse time. It is possible to master this skill, however, learning other defensive skills are more recommended, especially to low level players where this skill has very few merits for having it mastered. This skill may be helpful in large-scale raids where players may need to defend against a dragon's breath or similar threat. For this reason, market prices of skill scrolls for this skill are always high.

Barrier of Bell Chimes -- Defensive Magic
When using most barrier skills, the user must cast another barrier over a weaker one to maintain its protection. This skill, however, allows barriers to be strengthened, possibly allowing a Kannagi to maintain just one barrier in battle. When used, ripples appear on the tip of one's weapon, with a clear sound of bells resonating in the air.

Mystic Spell of the Three Offerings -- Special Skill, Offensive Magic, Defensive Magic
Inflicts high damage on one enemy and summons a powerful barrier on all members of the party. It is considered to be one of the best Kannagi skills, but can only be used once every 24 hours. The durability of the barrier summoned depends on the target enemy's level and the skill rank, making it effective against weak mobs and raid bosses alike. However, compared to most damage skills which are ranged, this skill must be cast from a shorter distance from the enemy, as risk to be considered when using this skill.

When cast, a sacrificial altar appears at the target's feet, and the target's life force seeps away into the sky as a bluish-white light.

Prayer to the Four Directions -- Special Skill, Defensive Magic
The user and one's allies are surrounded by barriers of white, black, red and blue similar to that of Purification Barriers, forming a rectangular prism. Summons more durable barriers and has an almost-zero cast time, as well as it can be used even when unable to cast skills due to inhibiting effects. However, it can only be used once within 24 hours.


//==Medicine Man==\\
The North American replacement for the Medium/Kannagi class. They use the power of the earth from totems as well as meditation to heal and defend. Using the power of various spirits, they also have a wide variety of attacks.

Ghost Walk (ゴーストウォーク) -- Damage Nullification, Special Skill
A unique magic of the Medicine Man class that diverts damage by transforming into an ethereal body.

God-Dropping Ceremony (神卸しの儀) -- Attack

Call Totem (コール・トーテム) -- Attack
 
//==Assassin==\\
Fully translated here: http://lh.oksub.me/wiki/Assassin
 
Sample Builds:
Shadow Blade - The Surprise Attack Build
The orthodox build of an Assassin, focusing on sneak attack and burst damage.
Because the large amount of damage easily attracts Hate, it is important to use movement skills and hate mitigation skills.
This build leans more towards solo players, giving the nickname “Solo Assassin” and “Lonely Assassin”.
Akatsuki uses this build. She specializes in aiming for vital spots using a one-handed, lightweight dagger. There are other variations of this build that go for mortal blows using large two-handed weapons.

Sniper - Standard Marksmanship Build
Specializes in long-ranged attacks using longbows or crossbows. Along with barrages from <Rapid Shot> or <Spark Shot>, enemies are frozen in place with status effects from skills like <Paralyzing Blow>. While it’s easy to inflict high damage with a Sniper build, this also puts Snipers at risk of disrupting the frontlines and drawing Hate away from the tanks. Contrary to its appearances, this is a build that requires a lot of Hate micromanagement.
For solo players, inflicting status effects on enemies and making full use of movement skills is necessary.
William is a raid sniper, while Hien is of the solo variety. Woodstock W is also a sniper using a crossbow.

Sword Dancer - Emphasis on Number of Attacks
A dual-wielding build focusing on more steady damage. Unlike the Shadow Blade build that builds combos from hidden bodies and sneak attacks, Sword Dancers focus on a continuous rush of attacks.
While its damage output isn’t inferior to Shadow Blades’, skill cooldowns can be a concern. As a result, those using the Sword Dancer build increase damage efficiency with weapon effects.
Leonardo and Kazuhiko use this build.

//==Swashbuckler==\\
Link: http://ncode.syosetu.com/n5313bu/17/
**Attack**
Viper's Trash (ヴァイパーストラッシュ) -- Debuff Skill
By attacking the arm tendons and causing bleeding, it causes DOT by bleeding for tens of seconds and a decrease in accuracy. The enemy will see a hit effect like a snake's teeth stabbing in and an icon indicating blood loss. Ever since the "Catastrophe" it has been confirmed that this skill will cause quite a bit of blood to flow, but to date, there haven’t been any "Death by blood loss" cases confirmed.
 
Early Thrust (アーリースラスト) -- Attack Support, Special Skill
Perform a preemptive strike using your equipped weapon. It is noted not only for its sheer speed, but also for giving its target a special marker that amplifies the damage inflicted by allies on the marked target. After the Catastrophe, the debuff comes in the appearance that resembles a playing card at the point designated by the attack. The marker disappears when attacked, dealing additional damage to the marked target. Swashbucklers are known for this "bonus damage marker", although its damage potential is lower compared to an Assassin's. However, combining Early Thrust with the Assassin's special skill Assassinate allows for a greater burst of damage. Also, the possibility of stacking many markers on enemies allows for the battle to end when desired, making Swashbucklers a barometer of sorts in battle.
 
Break Trigger (ブレイクトリガー) -- Special Skill
A finishing move that detonates all markers set on enemies at once. When activated, it triggers a chain reaction of explosions, dealing a great amount of damage. Although its cooldown makes it inconvenient to use in rapid succession, it depends on a longer set-up time due to its dependence on the amount of markers on an enemy. For this reason, perfect timing is essential to maximize the effects of this skill in the thick of battle. In boss fights or in encounters with high-HP mobs, the chances of setting up markers for Break Trigger increase a lot, so high-end parties often rely on this skill. Because of its "exploding" effect, this skill is often called "bomb" or "fireworks" ("setting up the bomb/fireworks" in a sense) and is a mesmerizing moment for allies to watch when triggered.
 
Whirlwind (ワールウィンド)
Swipes away enemies surrounding the user with one's weapon. Its cost and damage is balanced, and is considered as the signature area-of-effect skill of Swashbucklers and a skill often used by most Swashbucklers.
 
Quick Assault (クイックアサルト) -- Movement Skill
Performs a quick charge attack. Known for its low damage, quick cast time, and very short freeze time. It is often used after using other offensive skills as a combo filler, allowing for a quick succession of attacks. One thing to consider is that the use of Quick Assault can maintain or interrupt one's momentum in battle due if one flinches.
 
Round Windmill (ラウンドウィンドミル)
Leap into the air and unleash an array of attacks while spinning on mid-air. A rather long freeze time follows after use, but enemies successfully hit by the skill will also be momentarily rendered immobile for a short time. Is often used when the ally party outnumbers the enemy party. On the other hand, using this while solo is a doable, but risky tactic. When performing this skill, there is a short period where the user is invulnerable to attacks, and many veteran players use this short period as an emergency evasion maneuver. However, lag affects this invulnerability effect so much that it is considered a taboo to use this skill for such a purpose. When the skill is used, the path of the user and its weapon glows, creating a shape similar to the wings of a paper pinwheel.
 
End of Act (エンドオブアクト) -- Special Skill
A finishing move of Swashbucklers that deals a stylish, quick slash. Because of the skill's wide attack range and probability of dealing instant death that increases with a widening level gap, it is possible to annihilate groups of Minion-type enemies in a blow. Swashbucklers specializing in mopping-up have become synonymous with this skill. When this skill is used, you become a blur, appearing briefly to slash the opponent before returning to your starting position once the attack is complete. Cooldown time is 320 seconds, so it is difficult to use it more than once in a battle.
 
Danse Macabre (ダンスマカブル) -- Special Skill
Substantially increase damage dealt for one blow by activating this skill right before you hit your opponent. It deals around 20% less damage in comparison to an Assassin's, but this skill can be called a Swashbuckler's <Assassinate>.
 
Thrust Joker (スラストジョーカー) -- Two-Handed Weapons-only
A swinging attack that is only available when using a two-handed weapon. There is a low probability of hitting, but if you do, you land a critical hit while ignoring the DEF of the opponent, and there is a short cooldown time, so you can continuously use this ability (although it still uses up MP, so there is a limit). When you hit, there is a flashier effect than normal and a Joker card is flipped. The critical hit, even at max level, is around 5%. As a result, if you want a build based around <Thrust Joker>, you want CRIT-raising equipment.
 
Bloody Piercing (ブラッディピアッシング) -- Movement Inhibition
Slash the target's lower body, especially targeting the feet, to lower its evasion. When you hit, an effect like a piercing fang or ice pick appears. Similar to <Viper's Thrash>, so people consider it weaker because there is no Bleeding debuff; however, overall damage output will rise because all allies' attacks will have a higher chance of landing. Appropriate usage of this skill is a sign of a skilled player. This skill is nicknamed "BloPi" (AKA burapi, since "Blood Piercing" is in kana so it's just shortened in a Japanese fashion).
 
Dual Bet (デュアルベット) -- Dual-wielding Skill
A Swashbuckler equipped with a weapon in each hand attacks consecutively. Your ability to break the enemy's defense is high. It's easy to add a lot of hitmarkers with this attack as well. This skill is a signature move of Swashbucklers.
 
Multiple Bets (マルチプルデッツ) -- Debuff Skill, Throwing Weapons-only Skill
Concentrate on a weak point or injury and aim towards those points to inflict status effects like Bleeding or prolong debuffs like Evasion Down.

Razor Edge (レイザーエッジ) -- Debuff Skill, Movement Inhibition
	You can interrupt an enemy that is casting a spell.

Flashing Draw (フラッシングドロウ) -- Throwing Weapons-only Skill
Opening Gambit (オープニングギャンビット) -- Attack Support, Special Skill
Lightning Step (ライトニングステップ) -- Attack Support, Movement Skill
Pinpoint (ピンポイント) -- Attack Support
Sharp Blade (シャープブレイド) -- Attack Support, Toggle-type, Advanced Skill
**Other**
Fencer Style (フェンサー・スタイル) -- Self-reinforcement, Passive
When one hand is not equipped with anything, the attack of the weapon in the other hand is boosted by 160+% to 220% (depending on skill level). At higher levels increases attack speed, critical chance and other attributes. There is no need to trigger it as it will automatically activate when the condition is met. If trained enough, it will not lose to dual-wielders or two-hand wielders in terms of attack power and even surpass them if the situation is right. Other classes such as assassins, bards or the warriors have similar skills.

The merits of the one-hand style as compared to dual-wielding or two-handed is that it is less of a burden financially to acquire and maintain only one weapon. However, to leave the slot of one hand empty would mean losing the boost in attributes and/or other effects that could have been used so it is not a clear-cut decision on which style to adopt.
 
Tomahawk Boomerang (トマホークブーメラン) -- Heavy Weapons-only Skill
Turkey Target (ターキーターゲット) -- Hate Control Skill
Wired Action (ワイアードアクション) -- Movement Skill, Whip-only Skill
Swell Buckler (スウェルバックラー) -- Hate Control Skill, Defense Skill, Shield-only Skill
Discard (ディスカード) -- Hate Control Skill
Unicorn Jump (ユニコーンジャンプ) -- Movement Skill
Special skill that allows you to move in a great leap. During the game era, this skill could only be used to jump over obstacles/enemies. After the Catastrophe, it can be used (and abused) to a much wider scale.

Quick Step (クイックステップ) -- Movement Skill

Sample Builds:
Concertmaster - Support Song Specialization
Supporting parties in large-scale battles, a Concertmaster uses skills such as <Battle Conduct>, <War Conductor>, <Curtain Drop>, and other such skills to increase his or her allies' attack ability. A Concertmaster is not expected to fight on the front lines, although they can use their auto-attack sometimes.
Henrietta uses this build.

Prima Actor - Special Attack Specialization
Using attack spells like <Duet>, <Grande Finale>, and <Prelude Onslaught> in conjunction with movement hindrance spells like <Ballad of the Gullible Snail>, a Prima Actor can increase the number or strength of either their own or their allies' attacks.
The main weakness of this build is that it is more effective against multiple enemies, and its effectiveness drops considerably against solo enemies.
Takayama Misa uses this build.

Virtuoso - Curse Song Specialization
Focuses on aiding allies using their Curse Songs to weaken opponents. However, this build is rather unpopular due to the relatively short range of Bard attacks compared to Assassins and Swashbucklers, as well as the lower damage it deals.
Like the Prima Actor, this build is difficult to solo with and is probably the least popular of the three sample builds.
Enkaatanto uses this build, and Isuzu begins focusing on this build in volume 8.

**Attack**
Maestro Echo (マエストロエコー) -- Attack Support, Special Skill
For approximately 30 seconds, copy a designated ally's magic attack on the same target. Since equipment bonuses and character stats are not copied over, your attack will be weaker, but will still deal around 150%-180% damage, especially if you copy a Sorcerer. When used, this skill creates a guitar-riff-like sound effect and a shining appearance. The attack will be a beat behind the original.

Resonance Beat (レゾナンスビート)
Imbues a weapon with a melody that causes a shockwave upon impact and resonates with the target's body. If another attack lands during the resonance period, additional damage will be dealt with a resonance explosion. You have to attack twice for it to work, so the damage dealt is quite high. Bards who use percussion instruments or blunt weapons like maces and have Resonance Beat as their signature move are known as "Drummers" or "Taiko Masters."

Elegant Act (エレガントアクト)
An elegant attack from a beautiful dance. The damage dealt is normal, but this skill boosts Evasion for a period of time after usage, so it's popular with front-line Bards since it improves their survivability. It is notable for the elaborate movements that vary depending on the weapon. With a sword, it's a sword dance; with a spear, the spear is twirled like a baton; with a scythe, the scythe is twirled like a pencil and is quite a sight to behold.

Battle Conduct (バトルコンダクト)
The damage is hardly any different from a normal attack, but gives the target a ! icon and puts them in the condition where "No matter how much it is hit, there will be no increase in hate". The icon appearance is short, around 5-15 seconds. Because of this, Bards will call their comrades when using it and all of them will use their most powerful skills in this limited time to pound the enemy into dust. When used, an attention-drawing whistle will be sounded. On forums, this whistle is also known as "Wolf Pack", "Beatdown Order" or "It's Hunting Time," among other nicknames. It allows all the party members to participate without restraint so it is a highly popular skill. It is considered a form of manners to greet a recruited Bard with "We're counting on your whistle-blowing today too ha ha" for private parties.

Arpeggio (アルペジオ) -- Special Skill
A broken chord. A ranged attack that targets all enemies, causing musical notes to pop out from the target that is hit. However, the resonance from the target disperses and decreases in damage dealt, and combined with a long cooldown time, this makes the skill less effective than a Swashbuckler's ranged attack. At the same time, because both the cooldown time and the decrease in damage is lowered (to around 90% normal damage at level 90) at higher levels, this skill is worth training.

Dissonance Scream (ディゾナンススクリーム) -- Abnormal State Skill
By causing a jarring dissonance in a circular radius around yourself, inflicting upon enemies within that area a small amount of damage and the Confusion status. When timed well, it can also cancel out spell incantations, so it is often used around Mage-type enemies. An effect of cracked notes flying about appears, and there is a shrieking sound effect echoes.

Final Strike (ファイナルストライク) -- Special Skill
Hurl your weapon and deal a large amount of damage. Damage depends on the remaining durability and attack power of the weapon, and even a normally-powerless player can be strong. However, the weapon's durability will become 0, and the weapon will be useless until repaired. Furthermore, the cooldown time is long, so you can't keep reusing this skill with several weapons on hand. Despite being a difficult skill to use, the fact that it creates a flashy effect when the weapon slices through an enemy and explodes makes it known as a "charming" skill that is rather popular. For a while, it was popular among Bards to use this skill as a finishing blow while strumming a stringed instruments.

Grand Finale (グランドフィナーレ)
A special skill named after the curtain pull. Perform a large-damage attack that sacrifices duration for speed, because it usually follows up a normal attack [TL: I need to revisit this sentence]. Additionally, damage increases when the target is inflicted with an abnormal status. If you kill an opponent with this skill, the screen would turn darker, the camera angle would change, and three spotlights would shine on the player. In subsequent updates, the camera angle change was removed because many people said that it was "overdone" and "it made it hard to see." Bragging about this skill is forbidden because even with the strongest Bard, it's only around 60% the strength of an Assassin or Sorcerer attack.

Duet (デュエット) -- Melee Attack
A skill performed with a melee weapon and an ally. Designate a friend as the target. When the ally hits the opponent during the time frame of this skill, you can follow up with another attack at a fixed chance. This attack is set as an auto-attack and only deals moderate damage, but you can expect an increase in damage dealt because it does not require practice or an incantation.

Because it is necessary to stand in a position where a melee attack can reach the target when you activate this skill, it is most often used with a tank, but some people take the chance and use it with a Swashbuckler, who has a higher attack speed. Damage dealt and duration of this spell depend on skill level, while the probability depends on skill rank.
**Curse**
Ballad of the Lazy Snail (のろまなカタツムリのバラッド) -- Movement Inhibition, Special Attack
An offensive curse song that deals minor damage and decreases the speed of the target and other monsters around it. The damage range is surprisingly large and can trap groups of 5 or 6. However, this skill garners more Hate, and you can become targeted if you are too careless with this skill. In situations where this isn't a concern, such as Solo play or a party without a tank, you can use this to drag enemies around and wear them down with ranged attacks. It seems there are anecdotes of wearing down a high level boss with only the ballad. On use a distorted spiral effect will appear around the target.

Lullaby of the Mermaid in Moonlight (月照らす人魚のララバイ) -- Movement Inhibition, Special Attack
A support curse song that puts the target enemy and those around it to Sleep. It is set so that the difference in level between the target and caster will affect how long it takes for them to fall asleep, so the effect is not instantaneous, and you might be countered if the target can see through the time it has before the effect occurs and cause a "Sleep Lock": "Attack right before effect occurs" then Sleep -> (Get hit) Wake up -> Immediate Sleep, rinse and repeat. When used, an aqua-blue ripple effect will occur and an image of a singing mermaid will appear over the head of the caster.

Träumerei of the Bear Cub's Dreams (夢見る小熊のトロイメライ) -- Movement Inhibition, Special Attack
A support curse song that gives the target and enemies within a certain area around it a Charm effect. A target that fails to resist it will be drawn to the Bard, advancing unsteadily. Because the effect wears off upon taking damage, allies will attack all at once. While in use, this skill creates a teddy bear turning a music box above the user's head, and the target has a spinning yellow star over its head. "Keep turning the music box" is a rough way of saying "Fool" in <Elder Tale>. (TL: Träumerei is Robert Schumann's most famous song in his work, Kinderszenen.)

Dirge of the Trapped Lion (囚われた獅子のダージュ) -- Special Attack
An attack curse song that traps enemies in a certain area and continuously deals damage. Although the damage dealt, like most curse songs, is insignificant, the damage builds up as you continue singing and the effect of an instant death is very powerful. The impact of an opponent who was fighting vigorously suddenly collapsing and dying has a very strong effect, and has given this skill the name of “Dying Song” and “the Voice of Death,” inspiring fear. When this skill is being used, a mark of a lion appears over the target’s head and a stinging chain wraps around them.
**Cover Songs**
Have a wide range of effect and last until they are turned off (toggle-type). Bards can play up to two Cover Songs at a time.

Etude Sword Speed (剣速のエチュード) -- Attack Support
Raises the weapon attack speed and accuracy of surrounding allies. You can immediately switch cover songs if necessary as long as you have a prerequisite song prepared [TL: will revisit]. However, having two cover songs active reduces MP. When this song is in use, a red-colored note appears from the Bard's body. Additionally, a sword icon appears over the allies under this effect.

Onslaught Prelude (猛攻のプレリュード) -- Attack Support
Shorten cooldown times of your allies' skills. It is a basic song used in battle to decrease the cooldown of magic and weapon attacks. Popular skill that is known to be refreshing to hear.

Anthem of the Affectionate Mother (慈母のアンセム) -- Recovery Support
Increases rate of HP recovery for allies. Although the amount of HP recovered per second is far less than a Druid's "pulsation recovery" ability, it has a similar effect, and can be used in conjunction with their skills. Also, the effect lasts until the cover song is switched, while Druid skills are finite in duration. When in use, a green note appears every two minutes. It can also be used outside of battle to shorten break times.

Coward's Fugue (臆病者のフーガ) -- Hate Reduction
Reduces Hate an ally receives when attacking by 5-15%. As proficiency rises, the percentage reduced increases. It is a powerful skill, powerful enough that it would accidentally decrease a tank's ability to aggro opponents. Now, Bards can choose whom not to affect with this skill. While in use, it creates dark blue notes that appear slowly.

Venomoid Tarantella (毒抜きのタランテラ) -- Recovery Support
Speeds up recovery from afflictions. Although you do not cure it immediately, you can cut down the normal time it takes to recover from them (around half). While some afflictions cannot be cured with this song, it is still an important skill for Raids. This skill becomes more effective by raising skill rank, so many seek the Secret scroll for this skill. [TL: The name is a reference to tarantulas, after which "Tarantella" was named after.]

Rainbow Arabesque (虹のアラベスク) -- Attack Support
Grants your allies an attribute such as fire or ice. This way, you can compound on an enemy's weak point. There are six attributes in total (if you don't have any selected, it is the seven colors of the rainbow), and you could click on which one use. After the Catastrophe, you can select it with your mind. A note of the corresponding color appears, and the weapons have a different effect depending on the attribute.

Meditation Nocturne (瞑想のノクターン) -- Recovery Support
Allies' MP, which is usually not restored during battle, recovers slowly. Although the rate is slower than when you are resting, its ability in the long run cannot be underestimated. In use, a cool-colored note (purple/blue) appears from your body.

Pavane Dance (舞い踊るパヴァーヌ) -- Defense Support
Increases the agility and evasion rate of allies. It allows Guardians, who usually don't have high evasion, to take advantage of it the way Monks do. In use, a yellow-colored note appears from the Bard's body.

Fawn March -- Status Buff
When activated, the skill increases the caster's allies' movement speed and support skills.
**Other**
War Conductor (ウォーコンダクター) -- Support
Instead of increasing your ally's speed, decrease your own. You can continue to support them with your songs while they go on ahead. Because it is an auto-attack, incantations are shortened, and strength increases. It creates an effect of a person waving a baton overhead.

Curtain Drop (カーテンドロップス) -- Hate Control Support
Decreases the Hate of one enemy. The number isn't shown, but because the enemy switches targets quite quickly, the amount of Hate reduced must be appropriately large. You can evade attack by using it on yourself, or you can use it on an ally at a higher MP cost. This creates an effect of a curtain wrapping around the target.

Repeated Notes (リピートノート)
Immediately repeats an attack/skill on the same target. However, you will be paralyzed for a short while after activating this skill. Furthermore, this attracts quite a bit of Hate, so using it too hastily can result in a disaster. [TL: I gave up on the effect.]

Shifting Tact (シフティングタクト)
Support skill for one ally. For a short duration (approx. 10 seconds), drastically decrease the cooldown time of the ally's skills. Acceleration is by 7% at elementary level, so the Secret-level scroll, which speeds it up by 32%, is in high demand. A metronome appears over the ally, and a "katchikatchikachikachikachi..." sound effect is heard.

Decrescendo (デクレシェンド) -- Hate Control Support
Become paralyzed for a while and decrease Hate slowly. While you can dispel this effect at any time, the amount of Hate that decreases is in proportion to the duration held. Although you cannot use any other skills during this time without dispelling the effect, cover songs are still in play, so you're still contributing to the fight.

Performance (パフォーマンス)
Perform on the streets or in taverns to earn money. The amount you make depends on your skill and Luck.

Bard Style (バルド・スタイル)
	Increases your endurance.

Typical Props (ティピカルプロップス)
Special ability that allows you to know the lore behind the songs you learn as a <Bard> through the eyes of the song’s creator.

Energy Weapon (エナジーウェポン)

**Close-Quarters Combat**
Icicle Impel (アイシクルインペール)
A combined magical and weapon-based skill that enchants your weapon with cold air magic, wrapping your body in a chilly blue aura. Even after getting hit, the aura continues wrapping around you for a period of time, increasing your attack evasion rate. Along with Inferno Strike and Thunderbolt Crush, it is a special melee-fighting skill. Because it increases attack evasion, many Sorcerers use it as emergency preparation for an enemy’s special move.

Inferno Strike (インフェルノストライク)
A combined magical and weapon-based skill that imbues your weapon with fire magic. When an attack hits, a small blast effect surrounds the target and causes them to take continuous Burning damage for a period of time. Although it is powerful, it’s still a melee attack and thus requires you to be in close proximity to your target. As a result, it’s a skill that requires a discerning eye and a great deal of determination to use. There are some uncommon melee-combat builds centered around the usage of this skill called “Magic Knight,” “Magic Swordsman,” etc.
