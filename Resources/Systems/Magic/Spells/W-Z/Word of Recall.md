You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly [[Teleport|teleport]] to a previously designated [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]]. You and any creatures that [[Teleport|teleport]] with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]] (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]], the spell has no effect.

You must designate a [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]] by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isnâ€™t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.
