# **Spell Level:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredible time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote— are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p><p> </p><p>Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>



 

# **Spell Slots:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level.</p><p><em>For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</em></p><p> </p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot.</p><p><em>So when Umara casts <strong>magic missile</strong>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</em></p><p> </p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see rules on <strong>resting</strong>).</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# **Casting a spell at a Higher Level:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts <strong>magic missile</strong> using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <strong>magic missile</strong> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p> </p><p>Some spells, such as <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>cure wounds</strong>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 
<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>WHAT LEVEL IS A SPELL IF YOU CAST IT WITHOUT A SPELL SLOT?</strong></p><p>Such a spell is cast at its lowest possible level, which is the level that appears near the top of its description. Unless you have a special ability that says otherwise, the only way to increase the level of a spell is to expend a higher-level spell slot when you cast it.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>The warlock’s Chains of Carceri feature lets a warlock cast <em>hold monster</em> without a spell slot. That casting of <em>hold monster</em> is, therefore, 5th level, which is the lowest possible level for that spell.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>The warlock’s Thief of Five Fates feature lets a warlock cast <em>bane</em> with a spell slot, which means the spell is 1st level or higher, depending on the slot that the warlock expends to cast it.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>The monk’s Disciple of the Elements feature lets the monk spend ki points, rather than a spell slot, to increase the level of a spell.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p>This rule is true for player characters and monsters alike, which is why the innate spellcasters in the <em>Monster Manual</em> must cast an innate spell at its lowest possible level.</p><p> </p></tbody></table>

 

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>If a character has levels in more than one class, do the character’s cantrips scale with character level or with the level in a spellcasting class?</strong></p><p>Cantrips scale with character level. For example, a barbarian 2 / cleric 3 casts sacred flame as a 5th-level character.</p></tbody></table>
