A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

 

# **Verbal Component (V):**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the **silence** spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component |

 

# **Somatic Component (S):**

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. |

 

# **Material Component (M):**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spell-casting focus</strong> (found in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p></blockquote><p> </p><blockquote><p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>
