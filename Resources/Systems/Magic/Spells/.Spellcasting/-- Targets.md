# **TARGETS:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p><p> </p><p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

 

# **A Clear Path To The Target:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.</p><p> </p><p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

 

# **Targeting Yourself:**

| If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. |
