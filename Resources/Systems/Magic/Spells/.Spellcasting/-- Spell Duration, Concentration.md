A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

 

 

# **Instantaneous:**

| Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant. |

 
 

# **Concentration:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p><p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p></blockquote><ul><li><blockquote><p><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</p></blockquote></li></ul><blockquote><p>Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</p></blockquote><p> </p><blockquote><p>The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>


<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><strong>IF YOU’RE CONCENTRATING ON A SPELL, DO YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN LINE OF SIGHT WITH THE SPELL’S TARGET?</strong></p><blockquote><p>You don’t need to be within line of sight or within range to maintain concentration on a spell, unless a spell’s description or other game feature says otherwise.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>If I have 10 temporary hit points and I take 30 damage from an attack while concentrating on a spell, what is the DC of the Constitution save to maintain my concentration?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The DC is 15 in that case. When temporary hit points absorb damage for you, you’re still taking damage, just not to your real hit points. In contrast, a feature like the wizard’s Arcane Ward can take damage for you, potentially eliminating the need to make a Constitution saving throw or, at least, lowering the DC of that save.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><strong>CAN A SPELLCASTER DISMISS A SPELL AFTER CASTING IT?</strong></p><blockquote><p>You can’t normally dismiss a spell that you cast unless (a) its description says you can or (b) it requires concentration and you decide to end your concentration on it. Otherwise, a spell’s magic is unleashed on the environment, and if you want to end it, you need to cast dispel magic on it.</p></blockquote><p> </p></tbody></table>
