# **SAVING THROWS:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</strong></p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

 

# **ATTACK ROLLS:**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. <strong>Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see chapter 9).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
