When you choose this technique at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action against a creature that is surprised, you can make one additional attack against that creature as a part of that action.

MARK OF THE STALKER

Also at 3rd level, while you are hidden from the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, the first attack roll you make each round against that creature does not automatically reveal your presence to that creature.

CONCEALMENT

Beginning at 7th level, you've become adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision.

While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack while hidden, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your

next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

STALKER'S FLURRY

Starting at 11th level, if you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

  

STALKER'S DODGE

At 15th level, whenever a creature attacks you and does not have advantage, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the creature's attack roll against you. You can use this feature before or after the attack roll is made, but it must be used before the outcome of the roll is determined.

FIGHTING STYLE

MANEUVERS

You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

SUPERIORITY DICE

You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the fighter table. This die changes as you gain fighter levels, as shown in the Combat Superiority column of the scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.

You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

SAVING THROWS

Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

MANEUVERS

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

  

COMMANDER'S STRIKE

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

DISARMING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

DISTRACTING STRIKE

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

EVASIVE FOOTWORK

When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

FEINTING ATTACK

You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

GOADING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

LUNGING ATTACK

MANEUVERING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

MENACING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

PARRY

When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

PRECISION ATTACK

When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

PUSHING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

RALLY

On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

RIPOSTE

When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

SWEEPING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack.

Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

TRIP ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

FIGHTING MASTERY

BRUTE FORCE

When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, once per turn, when you deal damage with a weapon, you can deal an additional 1d4 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage. If this damage would affect multiple creatures, you can only apply this damage bonus to one of them.

BRUTISH DURABILITY

If applying this bonus to a death saving throw increases the total to 20 or higher, you gain the benefits of rolling a 20 on the d20.

ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE

At 10th level, you can choose a second fighting style option.

ROCK STEADY

When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have learned to use the heft of your weapon to root yourself in place. At the end of each of your turns, if you move less than half your speed while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being restrained, moved, or knocked prone. This advantage lasts until the end of your next turn.

MY LITTLE FRIEND SAYS HELLO THERE

Also at 3rd level, you know how to use the sheer size of your weapon to strike fear in those around you. You can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma (Intimidation) check you make while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties that doesn't already include that modifier.

MAXIMUM OUTPUT

Beginning at 7th level, when you take the Attack action while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you can forgo one or more attacks. If you do so, the first time you deal damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon's damage. If this instance would deal damage to multiple creatures, you can only apply this additional damage to one of them. For each attack you forgo, you deal additional damage equal to 1d12 + half your fighter level (rounded down). If you miss with the first attack roll you make before the end of your next turn, or one target succeeds on the saving throw against your weapon's burst or rapid property, you instead deal normal weapon damage.

STRAIGHT THROUGH

you hit with the first attack roll you make, or if one creatures fails the saving throw against your

weapon's burst or rapid property, before the end of your next turn, you treat the hit as a critical hit. If

you miss with the first attack roll you make before the end of your next turn, or one target succeeds on the saving throw against your

weapon's burst or rapid property, you instead deal normal weapon damage.

If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.

You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can't have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can't have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.

Tumble (Acrobatics). You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature's reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.

You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach.

Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.

You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Wrestle (Athletics). You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

TECHNOLOGIST'S EXPLOIT

You learn and can cast one 1st-level tech power once per long rest. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You require use of a wristpad for this power.

You can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different power.

WEAPONMASTER'S EXPLOIT

You gain proficiency in three blasters or vibroweapons that lack the heavy and strength properties.

You can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose different weapons.

OPERATIVE PRACTICES

Operatives have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different operatives steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the different operative practices. Your practice grants you features at 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

ACQUISITIONS PRACTICE

Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.

FAST AND AGILE

When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

Additionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power.

When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement.

DEFT HANDS

Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you

deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack

dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.

  

Some of your aerial maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

Deft Hands save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

HINDER

You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.

PILFER

You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

TUMBLE

You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.

SUPREME SNEAK

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.

AERIAL AGILITY

Starting at 13th level, your agility in the air grants you the following benefits:

When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.

Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.

THIEF'S REFLEXES

When you reach 17th level, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

BEGUILER PRACTICE

Those operatives who choose the Beguiler Practice augment their natural wiles and charm with subtle utilization of the Force. They tap into these powers to cloud the minds of their foes, distracting and diverting before abruptly dispatching them.

FORCECASTING

When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

FORCE POWERS KNOWN

You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

FORCE POINTS

You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

MAX POWER LEVEL

Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once.

You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

  
  

FORCECASTING ABILITY

Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

FASCINATING DISPLAY

Also at 3rd level, you can spend 1 minute attempting to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who

  
  
  

BEGUILER PRACTICE FORCECASTING

watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw

  

(DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

MESMERIZING PRESENCE

Beginning at 9th level, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.

ENTHRALLING VIGOR

Starting at 13th level, whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

GUNSLINGER PRACTICE

Those operatives who choose the Gunslinger Practice are the masters of the trick shot. The Gunslinger and his blaster are the perfect team, utilizing knowledge of their enemies' vulnerabilities to take advantage of every opportunity.

DIVE FOR COVER

When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn to quickly move into cover when under fire. Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

TRICK SHOOTER

Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot.

Some of your trick shots require your target to make

a saving throw to resist the trick

shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

BLINDING SHOT

You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

BRUTAL SHOT

You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

HAMPERING SHOT

You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.

SPINNING FLOURISH

Beginning at 9th level you can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus

+ your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

  

RICOCHET SHOT

Starting at 13th level you learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).

QUICKDRAW

At 17th level, you learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted. Choose up to six such creatures that you can see, making a ranged weapon attack against each. On a hit, you deal normal weapon damage and can apply a single trick shot to each attack made this way.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

  

SHARPSHOOTER PRACTICE

Those operatives who choose the Sharpshooter Practice are bringers of death. Striking from a safe distance, the Sharpshooter uses precision shooting to control the battlefield and bring targets down quickly.

ASSUME THE POSITION

Beginning at 3rd level, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if your target is greater than 30 feet from you and no enemies are within 5 feet of you. Additionally, standing up from prone now only costs 5 feet of movement.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with two martial blasters of your choice.

PLACED SHOTS

Also at 3rd level, you perfect the art of placing distant shots for maximum effectiveness in debilitating and controlling your enemies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a placed shot.

  

Some of your placed shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the placed shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Placed Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

DISARMING SHOT

You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.

PENETRATING SHOT

You attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

SUPPRESSIVE SHOT

You attempt to pin the target to its location. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

HEAD SHOT

At 9th level, you are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet.

Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

DISTRACTING SHOT

Starting at 13th level, you are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.

DOUBLE TAP

At 17th level, you've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no action required). Both attacks can benefit from your Sneak Attack damage, instead of only one.

(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack Combat suit, a set of tinker's implements, a vibrodagger, and a wristpad

  

TECHCASTING

Beginning at 1st level, during your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

TECH POWERS KNOWN

You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

TECH POINTS

You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest. 

TECHCASTING FOCUS

You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.

POTENT APTITUDE

Also at 1st level, your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

INFUSE ITEM

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

QUICK THINKING

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.

ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES

The wide range of tool applications gives birth to well defined distinctions between different engineering disciplines. Each discipline focuses on maximizing the personal use of a certain tool. Your discipline grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

ARMORMECH ENGINEERING

Those engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in armormech's implements, medium armor, and heavy armor. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armormech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

MODIFIED ARMOR

Also at 3rd level, you learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC. At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

DAMAGE ABSORPTION

Lastly at 3rd level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

ARMORMECH'S CELERITY

At 14th level, when you take the Attack action or use your action to a cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

SUIT RELIABILITY

Starting at 18th level, your suit is like a second skin. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw that uses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

ARMORMECH MODIFICATIONS

If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

ABSORPTION SHIELD

Physical Shield

You modify your physical shield to block incoming damage. As a bonus action you can activate this ability and gain temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + Intelligence modifier, which last for one hour. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

ACCELERATED MOVEMENT

Armor

You reduce the weight of your modified armor's bulk and increase the power to joints. If the armor has a Strength requirement, you ignore it. The modified armor's weight is reduced by 15 lbs. While wearing your modified armor your speed increases by 10 feet. This applies to all movement speeds you have while wearing your armor.

ADAPTABLE ARMOR

Armor

You integrate deployable hooks and fins into your armor, augmenting its mobility. While wearing your modified armor, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

ADVANCED POWER FIST

11th level, Armor Prototype Power Fist

You further modify your modified armor's gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor's unarmed strike deals 1d8 kinetic damage. Additionally, your critical hit range with your unarmed strikes increases by 1.

ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

9th level, Armor

You install an artificial intelligence into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor, when you make an ability check, your armor's artificial intelligence can take the Help action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

As a part of this bonus action, or as a bonus action on a following turn, you can cause the energy to erupt early. Each creature within

5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.

A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

The range at which you can launch your volley increases to 60 feet at 9th level, and 120 feet at 17th level.

This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION

Beginning at 6th level, you can add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that don't already include that modifier. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.

If you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table.

EXPERIMENTAL OVERRIDES

At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.

ENGINEERING BOMBARDMENT

Starting at 18th level, the harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.

## Artificer Features

### As an artificer, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

### Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level

### Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier

### Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

### Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields

### Weapons: Simple weapons

### Tools: Thieves' tools, tinker's tools, one type of artisan's tools of your choice

### Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence

### Skills: Choose two from [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana), [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History), [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation), [Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception), [Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand)

### The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the [rules on firearms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms) in the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg) and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

#### Equipment

### You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- ### any two simple weapons of your choice
    
- ### a light crossbow and 20 bolts
    
- ### your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail
    
- ### thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack
    

#### Magical Tinkering

### At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- ### The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
    
- ### Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
    
- ### The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
    
- ### A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
    

### The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

### You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

#### Spellcasting

### You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.

##### Tools Required

### You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically [thieves’ tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/thieves-tools) or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “[Equipment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment),” in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb) for descriptions of these tools.

### After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

##### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)

### At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the [artificer spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717). At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

### When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

### The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [artificer spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717). When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

### You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE

### As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.

### The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.

### Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.

##### Spellcasting Ability

### Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting

### You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Infuse Item

### At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.

##### Infusions Known

### When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “[Artificer Infusions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#ArtificerInfusions-1131764)” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the [Artificer table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#TheArtificerTable).

### Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

##### Infusing an Item

### Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “[Attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement)” in chapter 7 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg)).

### Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.

### You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the [Artificer table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#TheArtificerTable). You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

### If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

#### Artificer Specialist

### Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

#### The Right Tool for the Job

### At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

#### Ability Score Improvement

### When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Tool Expertise

### Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

#### Flash of Genius

### Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

### You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Magic Item Adept

### When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

- ### You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
    
- ### If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.
    

#### Spell-Storing Item

### At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared).

### While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

#### Magic Item Savant

### At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

- ### You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
    
- ### You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
    

#### Magic Item Master

### Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.

#### Soul of Artifice

### At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

- ### You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
    
- ### If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

ACADEMIC SUPERIORITY

Beginning at 1st level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

MANEUVERS

You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

SUPERIORITY DICE

You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.

You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

SAVING THROWS

Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

MANEUVERS

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

ADMINISTER AID

As an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.

ASSESS THE SITUATION

You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.

CRIPPLING STRIKE

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to cripple the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll and the creature's gains 1 slowed level until the end of their next turn.

DELIBERATE MOVEMENT

You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of standard difficult terrain until the end of your turn.

  

EXPLOIT WEAKNESS

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

GOADING ATTACK

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

HEADS UP

When a friendly creature who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.

MEASURED ACTION

As a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.

ONE STEP AHEAD

When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.

TARGETED STRIKE

When an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS

Also at 1st level, you are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:

When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.

When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.

DISCOVERY

As you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills.

At 2nd level, you master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.

SAGE ADVICE

When you reach 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.

EXPERTISE

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 10th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

ACADEMIC PURSUIT

Also at 3rd level, you dedicate your studies towards a pursuit, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, and 17th level.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

MULTITASKER

Starting at 5th level, you can take a second reaction each round. You can only take one reaction per turn.

  

Additionally, when a friendly creature you can see that can hear you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to target them with your Critical Analysis feature.

CALM AND COLLECTED

Beginning at 14th level, when you make a saving throw caused by an effect you can see, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must wait until a short or long rest before you can use it again.

ADAPTABLE INTELLECTUAL

At 18th level, you are able to effectively prepare for any mission on hand. At the end of a long rest, you may choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.

KNOWLEDGE UNBOUND

When you reach 20th level, you are the pinnacle of your pursuit. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for that score increases by 4.

Additionally, you can use any maneuver you know without expending a superiority die, rolling a d4 instead.

DISCOVERIES

The discoveries are presented in alphabetical order. If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the discovery at the same time you meet its prerequisites.

ACADEMIC MEMORY

You can recall anything you have read in the past month that you understand. This includes but is not limited to books, maps, signs, and lists.

ADAPTIVE

15th level

When the target of your Critical Analysis feature is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to change the target of your analysis to another creature within range.

AMBASSADOR

You learn three additional languages of your choice. You may choose this discovery multiple times.

CLEVER APPLICATIONS

You gain proficiency with improvised weapons, and they gain the finesse property for you. Additionally, when you make an attack with an improvised weapon, it deals 1d6 damage.

You can use your Sage Advice feature to give friendly creatures improvised weapon proficiency if they don't already have it, following the same rules of that feature as if it were a skill or tool. The friendly creatures retain this proficiency for the entire duration instead.

MENTAL PROWESS

When you make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to grapple a creature or break out of a grapple, net, and other restraining equipment, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.

HARDENED MIND

9th level

You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and on Intelligence checks to discern them from reality.

You also gain resistance to psychic damage.

LIFELONG LEARNING

You gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools. You can select this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.

LINGERING ADVICE

5th level

When you use your Sage Advice feature, the targeted creatures retain the benefit from your instruction for the full duration.

MASTER'S ADVICE

When you use your Sage Advice feature, the first time each targeted creature makes the chosen skill check, they gain an additional bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier.

PERFECT MANEUVER

15th level

When you roll a 1 on a superiority die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

QUICK ANALYSIS

9th level

When you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can use your reaction to use your Critical Analysis feature.

RESOLUTE

When you make a saving throw to resist charm and fear effects, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

RUNNING ON FUMES

You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits. Lastly, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.

SURVIVAL EXPERT

When you make a Survival skill check, you may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against poison.

TARGETED ANALYSIS

5th level

Your attack rolls against the target of your Critical Analysis feature cannot suffer from disadvantage.

TECH AMATEUR

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

You can communicate simple ideas with any creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher through basic expressions and gestures.

ACADEMIC PURSUITS

ADRENALINE HIT

You can use an action and expend one superiority die to inject a creature with regenerative medication that temporarily enhances their agility. When you do so, a creature you can touch regains hit points equal to the superiority die roll. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, when that creature would take damage, the amount is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.

EMERGENCY PRESCRIPTION

As an action, you can expend one superiority die and touch a creature. That creature regains hit points equal to result of the die + your Intelligence modifier, and when that creature makes their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn they roll the superiority die and add it to the roll.

ENHANCEMENT INJECTION

As an action, you can expend one superiority die to inject a creature you can touch with enhancements, granting them temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier, which last for 1 minute. Additionally, when the target makes a Strength or Constitution check or saving throw while it has these temporary hit points, it gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier.

REMOVE TOXINS

As an action, you can expend a superiority die to purge the toxins from a creature you can touch. The target regains hit points equal to the number rolled and, if it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease anicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

SMELLING SALTS

As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to heal a creature you can touch by a number of hit points equal to the number rolled.

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a finesse melee weapon, you can expend a superiority to give you or an ally that is within 5 feet of the creature a transfusion. Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature.

Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice.

Once you've reached 17th level, you've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.

Your medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

If you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d4 extra hit points.

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.

GAMBLER PURSUIT

Not all studied men and women use their intelligence and skill for the pursuit of knowledge, but instead turn to the various casinos and betting halls of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Gambler Pursuit use their knowledge of probability and risk to attempt to master games of chance and build their fortune, or lose it all along the way.

GAMBLER'S APTITUDE

When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you gain proficiency in three gaming sets of your choice, and you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses any of these gaming sets.

RISK VERSUS REWARD

Also at 3rd level, when you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.

This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.

ADDITIONAL MANEUVERS

Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your deep understanding of chance.

Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.

ALL IN

When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23, the attack is considered a critical hit.

  
  

BLIND LUCK

When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead.

DOUBLE BLUFF

If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.

THE IDIOT'S ARRAY

When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.

PLAYED THEIR HAND

When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this reaction.

On a success, the target drops the weapon it made the attack with. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.

  

PURE SABACC

When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.

RAISE THE STAKES

When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.

TAKE A CHANCE

Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.

TIEBREAKER

When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.

LUCKY NUMBER 7

Beginning at 6th level, whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table.

When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.

TELL ME THE ODDS

Starting at 9th level, if the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).

This die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.

BORROWED LUCK

Once you've reached 17th level, you have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.

While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

AGAINST THE HOUSE

Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.

ANTE UP

When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.

CALL THE GUARDS

FORCE OF PERSONALITY

Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Spellcasting

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting) for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content=) for the bard spell list.

##### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.

##### Spell Slots

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast [cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) using either slot.

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument (see the [Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools) section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

#### Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

#### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

#### Song of Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

#### Bard College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

#### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Font of Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) or [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed). A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

#### Expertise

At 10th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

#### Magical Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.

On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. On a failed save, for the next minute, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it must make an additional Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this feature doesn't restrict its movement for that turn.

This feature ends early if you attack another creature, if you target another hostile creature with a power or class feature, if a friendly creature damages the target, if a friendly creature targets it with a power or class feature, or if you target another creature with this feature. 

VOW OF THE OPEN MIND

You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Additionally, you can spend 1 focus point and 10 minutes meditating on a skill in which you are proficient.

You can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.

VOW OF SPIRIT

You can use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

VOW OF THE VERSATILE

When you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can instead make a melee weapon attack with a monk weapon you are wielding.

MONASTIC ORDERS

Orders of monastic pursuit are common in the locales scattered across the galaxy. Each order is based in a specific culture and is mutually exclusive, despite relying on the same basic techniques. Your order grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

CRIMSON ORDER

VIGILANT SENTINEL

Starting at 11th level, when you attempt to perceive your surroundings on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, you gain a +10 bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external

effect.

SOVEREIGN PROTECTOR

At 17th level, your mastery of focus has allowed you to unlock your fullest potential in combat. As a bonus action, you can gain the following effects for 1 minute.

Your speed is doubled. Your AC increases by 2.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

You gain an additional action of each of your turns. This action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

  

ECHANI ORDER

PATH OF THE ECHANI

Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. You gain the following benefits.

Agile Parry. If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an Echani weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.

You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

DEFT STRIKE

When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

UNERRING ACCURACY

At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

  
  

MATUKAI ORDER

INSTINCTIVE LEAP

At 6th level, when a hostile creatures moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to disengage and leap up to half your speed. If you end this movement in the air, you immediately fall to the ground.

ABSORB DAMAGE

Starting at 11th level, you learn to channel the Force into your skin and bones, greatly enhancing your durability. You can use a bonus action to channel the Force throughout your body. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to kinetic and energy damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

CONTROL THE FIELD

At 17th level, whenever you use your Instinctive Leap feature, you can leap your entire movement speed instead of only half.

Additionally, when you land, you can make an unarmed strike with advantage against a creature within 5 feet of you as

part of the same reaction. On a hit, this attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage.

  

NIGHTSISTER ORDER

Monks of the Nightsister Order utilize an innate Force- sensitivity to commune with death. They learn to channel this power to drain the life of their foes to prolong their own existence. Males who join this order are called Nightbrothers.

ICHOR LIGHTNING

Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, you gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged focus attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your focus ability modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is necrotic, and it uses your Martial Arts die for its damage die.

When you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can replace the attack with this one.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier + your monk level (your choice, minimum of one).

DARK MAGICK

At 6th level, you can use your action to force each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) of you until the end of your next turn.

SPIRIT BLADE ASSAULT

At 17th level, as an action, you conjure a blade of spirit energy and strike one creature within 5 feet of you with it, expending 1 to 10 focus points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per focus point spent, or half as much on a successful one.

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting) for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content=) for the wizard spell list.

With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [magic missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile), you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (see the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus) section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

YOUR SPELLBOOK

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

#### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

#### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

#### Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

HAWK'S INSTINCT

7th level

7th level

You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.

  

BALLISTIC APPROACH

  

FIRESTORM

When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

When making a ranged weapon attack while within 30 feet of your target, you use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.

EXPLOSIVE

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a blaster weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1

or a 2.

RAMPAGE

When you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target.

You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.

 DOWN, NOT OUT

Starting at 10th level, when you are hit with an attack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.

BRAWN

At 14th level, when you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one.

Additionally, when a creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, it is knocked prone.

  

MARAUDER APPROACH

Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force.

Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.

FORCECASTING

When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

FORCE POWERS KNOWN

You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

FORCE POINTS

You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

MAX POWER LEVEL

Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

FORCECASTING ABILITY

Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma

for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

  

FURIOUS FORCE

Also at 3rd level, you can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them.

Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.

  

POWERFUL PRESENCE

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

FORCE STORM

At 14th level, you can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one. 

  

FOCUSED RAGE

BATTLE ANTICIPATION

At 6th level, while raging, your critical hit range with melee weapon attacks using Dexterity increases by 1.

CALM WITHIN THE STORM

At 14th level, the precision with which you act during your rage causes you to become a storm of reactive lethality. When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus without using your reaction, and when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity against that creature. You can only take one reaction per turn.

  
  
  

WARCHIEF APPROACH

SAVAGE DIPLOMAT

Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself.

When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.

INSPIRING PRESENCE

At 6th level your mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage,

choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

RAID PLANNING

Starting at 10th level, you learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to their next initiative roll, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.

WAR CHANT

By 14th level you have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage you can take a commanding stance. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you have a special reaction you can take on a number of allies' turns equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You can only use this special reaction to use your Commanding Rage feature.

Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce that roll by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

  
  
  

WAY OF THE SAGE

  

DISCIPLE OF LIFE

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.

Additionally, whenever you use a force power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

PRESERVE LIFE

At 6th level, as an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier

(your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

BLESSED HEALER

Beginning at 10th level, the healing powers you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a force power that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

BLESSED BY THE FORCE

At 14th level you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

SUPREME HEALING

Starting at 18th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a power, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

WAY OF SUGGESTION

There is power in a light touch, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Suggestion have honed their attunement to the Force, allowing them to disappear, despite being in plain sight.

SUBTLE CONTROL

At 3rd level, you can befuddle a creature's mind with nothing but a gesture. As an action, you can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you can force the creature to believe or forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation or encounter it had that you were present for in the past 10 minutes. Whether the creature succeeds or fails their saving throw, you can't use this feature on them again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, creatures who attempt to detect your use of the Force have disadvantage on ability checks to do so, and if a creature has the sense force or force sight power active, they must succeed on a universal forcecasting ability check against your universal force

save DC in order to notice your usage of the Force, your alignment within the

Force, or how strong your connection to the Force is.

OUT OF MIND

At 6th level, you can erase yourself from a single creature's sight momentarily. As a bonus action,

choose a creature within 60 feet of you that you are aware of. That

creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your

universal force save DC.

On a failed save, you become invisible to

that creature for 1 minute, or until you

deal damage to it.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a

short or long rest.

DELICATE POTENCY

Beginning at 10th level, your mind-affecting powers are particularly potent. When you cast one of cloud mind, dominate mind, mass coerce mind, and dominate monster, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SUBTLE PRESENCE

At 18th level, you've learned how to weave the Force around you in a cloak of your choice. As an action, you can focus the Force for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain your choice of one of the following effects.

You can use each feature once. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

CLOAK OF FRIGHT

Each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY

You and everything you are wearing or carrying become invisible to creatures of your choice. If you damage a creature or affect it with a force power, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a success, you are no longer invisible to that creature.

CLOAK OF MEMORY

Creatures that see you or any allies within 30 feet of you during this time cannot recall your physical appearances, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.

Creatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC once the interaction ends. You can choose to exclude a creature from this effect. On a failed save, the creature forgets all details of the interaction, rationalizing any of its outcomes.

  
  

  

  
  

  

GUARDIAN

CAUSE HARM

As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), or half as much on a successful one.

LEND AID

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease anicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

FORCE-EMPOWERED STRIKES

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.

FIGHTING STYLE

Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

GUARDIAN AURA

When you reach 3rd level, you gain an aura of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description. You gain an additional aura at 10th and 18th level.

GUARDIAN FOCUS

Also at 3rd level, you begin to focus your studies on a specific lightsaber form, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your focus grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

FORCE PURITY

By 6th level, the Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.

IMPROVED FORCE-EMPOWERED STRIKES 

By 11th level, you are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Strikes with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Strikes. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.

CLEANSING TOUCH

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

GUARDIAN AURAS

The auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.

At 9th level, the range of these auras increases to 15 feet, and at 17th level, the range of these auras increases to 30 feet.

AURA OF CONQUEST

Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its speed is reduced to 0 and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.

Whenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

AURA OF PROTECTION

Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

AURA OF VIGOR

Whenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

AURA OF WARDING

You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.

GUARDIAN FOCI

Different guardians focus on different lightsaber styles, called Forms, as they hone their powers. Your focus grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

MAKASHI FORM

Makashi Form, also known as Contention Form, encourages precision and efficiency over power, using jabs, parries and light cuts over slashes, blocks and chops. Those guardians who focus on Makashi Form utilize calculated blade manipulation, intense focus, and expert timing to confuse and trap their opponents.

FORM BASICS

When you choose this form as your focus at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the chosen form. You gain the Makashi lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form. You can't take a lightsaber form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

THE WAY OF THE YSALAMIRI

Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can enter an offensive stance for one minute. While in this stance, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to the first melee weapon attack and damage rolls you make each turn.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

CHANNEL THE FORCE

Lastly at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel the Force option.

MAKASHI RIPOSTE

When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your guardian level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of the reaction.

SHATTERPOINT

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat,

you can use your connection to the Force to sense their strengths

and weaknesses, and learn certain information

about its capabilities compared to your

own. The GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

  

Strength score Dexterity score Wisdom score Charisma score Armor Class Current hit points

Total class levels (if any)

Total Forcecaster levels (if any)

GLANCING BLOW

By 15th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

MASTER OF CONTENTION

At 20th level, you are a duelist of the highest caliber. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage, and you ignore resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

All melee attacks have disadvantage against you. Your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional damage die.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you

finish a long rest.

  
  
  
  
  

93 CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | GUARDIAN

NIMAN FORM

Niman Form, also known as Moderation Form, strikes a balance between bladework and force powers. Those guardians who focus on Niman Form weave Force manipulation with their melee weapon strikes, pushing their opponents off-balance to create an opening.

FORM BASICS

When you choose this form as your focus at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the chosen form. You gain the Niman lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form. You can't take a lightsaber form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

THE WAY OF THE RANCOR

Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can enter a balanced stance for one minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, when you use your action to cast a force power, you can make one melee weapon attack. Additionally, for the duration, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

CHANNEL THE FORCE

Lastly at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel the Force option.

TELEKINETIC SLASH

When you deal damage with an at-will force power that requires a force attack or a saving throw, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the power's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.

ENLIGHTENMENT

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded down, minimum of one) to any saving throw you make that doesn't already include that modifier.

REDIRECT

By 15th level, when you would be affected by a weapon or force power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power requires a melee or ranged attack, make a melee or ranged force attack against the new target, as appropriate. If it requires a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC.

## DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

  

## CRAFTING

You can craft unenhanced objects, including

adventuring equipment and works of art. While you don't need to be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's implements), without proficiency you will lack the knowledge of what objects you can create. You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armstech's implements needs a workstation in order to craft a vibrosword.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 250 cr, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 250 cr, you make progress every day in 250-cr increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a heavy exoskeleton (market value 9,000 cr) takes 36 days to craft by yourself. 

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 250 cr worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a heavy exoskeleton in 12 days, at a total cost of 4,500 cr.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 cr per day. If you have expertise in your chosen tool, you can instead maintain a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 20 cr per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).

  

## PRACTISING A PROFESSION

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 cr per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you

continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organisation that can provide gainful employment, such as a syndicate or guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your

downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

  

## RECUPERATING

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.

For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

  

## RESEARCHING

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.

Research can include poring over dusty tomes and ancient datacrons in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumours and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 10 cr to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

TRAINING

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 10 cr per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.
