Introduction:

A common complaint about Savage Worlds is that the powers are too generic, bland and/or boring. What this criticism fails to recognise is that the powers are not really intended to be used out of the box, instead they should be viewed as templates for designing your own custom spells, each tailored to the needs and background of the individual character. The Fantasy Companion and Savage Worlds Deluxe make the concept easier to understand, and include informative sections about trappings, but the paradigm shift can still be quite difficult for people to grasp if they're used to playing games which offer large lists of pre-written (and frequently very restrictive in scope) spells. This document is an attempt to provide some examples of the sort of ways in which trappings can be used to design individual spells. It can serve as a spell list for those who don't feel confident enough to design their own trappings, but it’s certainly not exhaustive, and I would hope it encourages more people to express their creativity and invent their own spells. 

  

Skill, Edge and Item Trappings: 

Remember that powers aren’t the only way to represent spells, you could also apply magical trappings to skills, Edges and items. Your Lockpicking skill might actually be a Knock spell, Notice might reflect your arcane sight, the Intimidation skill could be used to represent your terrifying Soul Gaze, Taunt could represent distracting cantrips, etc. Likewise, Beast Master could be druidic magic, Connections or Danger Sense might come from necromancy, Natural Weapons (from Savage armory) could be used to build offensive spells, and so on. Even mundane equipment can be given trappings – leather armor to represent a warded duster, a bow to represent a wizard’s staff that shoots energy bolts, etc. 

  

Spell Trappings: 

When you choose a power, you must also choose its trappings. It is strongly recommended that players not be permitted to take powers without any trappings. At the very least they should come up with a name and description. 

  

Improvised Trappings:

If the GM allows improvised magic, players may spend a benny to use a different trapping for a power they already possess – or to use a power they don’t have with a trapping they do. For example someone with Flame Dart (Bolt) might spend a benny to cast Ray of Frost (Bolt) or Fireball (Burst with the same general trapping as Flame Dart). The benny must be spent before making the Spellcasting roll.

  

Reward Roll Tables:

  

Table 1

Roll a die to determine the type of power unlocked based off your your character Rank: Novice (d4), Seasoned (d6), Veteran (d8), Heroic (d10)

Legendary Power(s):

1. Portent
    
2. Wish
    

  
  

Spell List:

  

Absorb Elements

Rank: Novice

Power Points: 2

Range: Smarts

Duration: 5

The target gains +2 Armor against elemental damage (+4 with a raise). If hit by an elemental effect the next damage roll made by the target gains +1d4 (+1d6 with a raise) of that element. 

  

Acid Arrow 

Rank: Novice 

Power Points: 2 

Range: 2xSmarts

Duration: Instant 

You conjure a magical arrow which appears in the air beside you for a moment, before speeding towards the designated target. It inflicts 3d4 damage when it hits, and an additional 2d4 damage the next round. If the target is Shaken or wounded by the acid, there is a 1 in 6 chance of their armor losing 1 point of protection. 

  

Acid Rain 

Rank: Seasoned 

Power Points: 4 

Range: 2xSmarts 

Duration: Instant 

You conjure a cloud of acid rain within a Medium blast template, inflicting 3d4 damage and ignoring armor (unless completely sealed). This counts as a Heavy Weapon. Anyone hit by the acid rain suffers an additional 2d4 damage on the caster's next action, unless the acid is counteracted in some way. If a target is Shaken or wounded by the acid, there is a 1 in 6 chance of their armor losing 1 point of protection (regular clothing is simply ruined). If the spell is successfully cast, but the attack misses, the location of the rain deviates as if it were a fired projectile. The caster may increase the coverage to a Large blast template for 2 PP. 

  

Alter

Rank: Novice

Power Points: 1

Range: Smarts

Duration: 1 Minute

Change a non-living object (hand held-sized or smaller) into something else, though, it will not change its size or volume. Thus, a piece of parchment may be altered to a colored square of cloth or a sword may be made a simple walking stick.

  

Alter Self

Rank: Seasoned

Power Points: 5

Range: Self

Duration: 1 Minute

When you cast the power, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the power. While the power lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

- Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills, and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your Pace.
    
- Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also don’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the power, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.
    
- Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal Strength+d4 damage. If you already had natural weapons increase their damage by a die type.

Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or they are incapacitated. As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

This spell has no effect on non-living creatures.

At the start of your next turn, and when the power ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can end this power as an action.

The caster must then succeed a melee attack roll with a weapon against one creature within range, otherwise the spell fails and the caster returns to their starting position.

As an indirect spell it cannot miss if successfully cast, or benefit from called shots, but the damage is halved if the attack roll doesn't equal or exceed the TN. If the victim is incapacitated by this spell, the Vigor roll is made at -2; failure means their heart bursts from their chest and flies to the spellcaster's hand.

Fire and Ice

Power Points: 2 

Range: 2xSmarts 

Duration: Instant 

You shoot two bolts of magical energy at your foes, one fashioned from living flame, the other from blue-white coldfire. Both bolts inflict 2d6 damage and can cause flammable targets to catch fire, although the coldfire inflicts cold damage rather than heat for the purposes of immunities and weaknesses. If the coldfire bolt is fired at a target who is already on fire, it will extinguish the flames instead of inflicting damage - and the same the other way around, if a flame bolt is fired at a target who is burning with coldfire. If both bolts are fired at a single target they strike nearly simultaneously, and are treated as a single attack inflicting 3d6+2 damage against stone, glass, and similar materials, due to the sudden change in temperature. Against flesh, metal and other substances the combined attack inflicts 3d6- 2 damage, as the two bolts partially cancel each other out. When both bolts strike the same target, they cannot cause it to catch on fire (and will automatically extinguish any existing fire - this doesn't impact their damage).

Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area. A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first succeed a Spirit roll (at -2 if cast with a raise). On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a raise. 

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

- Burial: The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar traveI to get into or out of it.

- Hedged Prison: The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar traveI. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.
    
- Minimus Containment: The target shrinks and is imprisoned in a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar traveI. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.
    
- Slumber: The target falls asleep and cannot be woken.

The Living Smoke is a dying creature; as soon as it is “born” it feels life fading away and is eager to steal energy to prolong its existence. Any living target (undead and constructs are immune) caught in the Living Smoke must make a Vigor roll or suffer an automatic Wound, caused by the vicious creature sucking away its life force.

The Living Smoke is a treacherous creature: if at the end of its controller’s turn it hasn’t had the chance to suck life from someone, the controller must make a Spirit (+2) roll. In case of failure, the Smoke becomes an independent creature, controlled by the GM, and it's only goal is to prolong its life by stealing energy from the nearest living being.

On a raise, their Strength is reduced by two die steps, they suffer -2 Parry until their next action, and they are Shaken if not already.
