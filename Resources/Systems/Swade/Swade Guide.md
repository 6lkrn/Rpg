Character Creations
Concept
Come up with a character concept that catches your interest.

Race
Racial abilities all have a number value. In order to determine the final strength of your character’s race, add up all the number values of the abilities you have chosen. The total must not be higher than 2 (Unless the GM determines otherwise) 

Hindrancess
Hindrances are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances. You can take more Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!

For 2 points you can:
• Raise an attribute one die type
OR
• Choose an Edge

For 1 point you can:
• Gain another skill point
OR
• Gain additional starting funds equal to twice your setting’s starting amount.

Attributes
Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor
You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You’re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12 unless a racial ability says otherwise. If it does, each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12 + 2.

Skills
Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on. Skills in Savage Worlds are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The Shooting skill, for example, covers all types of guns, bows, rocket launchers, and other ranged weapons.

Core Skills: Unless a racial ability, Edge, or Hindrance says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, and Stealth. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. 

Buying Skills: 
If the skill is EQUAL to or LESS THAN its linked attribute it  costs 1 point to upgrade.
If the skill is HIGHER THAN its linked attribute it  costs 2 points to upgrade.
You have 12 points to spend on increasing your skills or buying new skills as you see fit. 
PLEASE NOTE: Increasing a dice from 0 to d4 (i.e. buying a new “Swimming” skill takes 1 point.
If you do not own a skill, you roll the skill with a 1d4-2. 

Skill Maximums: Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s race starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12 + 1. 

Derived Statistics
Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below. 

Pace: Pace is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. 

Parry: Parry is equal to 2 plus half your character’s Fighting die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat. For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12 + 1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12 + 1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12 + 2 results in a Parry of 9.

Size: A hero’s default Size is 0 unless altered by racial abilities, Edges, or Hindrances. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3. 

Toughness: Toughness is your hero’s damage threshold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm (explained later in Chapter Three). Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s Vigor, plus Armor (use the armor worn on his torso — see page 69). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.

Edges

Characters get Edges by taking Hindrances, from racial abilities, or Advances once play begins. Each Edge has a requirement that must be fulfilled, and a benefit that the player receives.

N: Novice (Levels 0-3)
S: Seasoned (Levels 4-7)
V: Veteran (Levels 8-11)
H: Heroic (Levels 12-15)
L: Legendary (Levels 16+)

Each edge costs 2 Hindrance points.

Background Details
Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you care to. Ask yourself why she’s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game? Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.
