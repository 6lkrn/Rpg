WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH MO DMING

### Session 1 

Went into the city

Visited the market

Went into a shop and tried to scam an old man

Chao told him we were from a bank and that his house was being seized 

Old man said which bank?

Chao made up some lies 

Mo said there were no banks in the city

Mo said the whole marketplace was getting angry and we were drawing attention 

Guards approached us, crowd was getting agitated

We left

Mo told Thierry that there were gangs of criminals following us from the rooftops

We went back towards the marketplace

Two men followed us

We talked to them, they wanted to go past us

Chao tried to pick pocket them - Nat Fail man caught his hand

Thierry tried to pick pocket his other pocket with mage hand - failed stealth roll\

We started fighting

Chao cast charm on the man but he didnt let go of his hand

Fight

Balky killed one man with a fire spell, the other one was knocked unconscious 

We stabbed one of them dead and put the knife in the  hands of the burnt corpse because Mo said guards were approaching

Single Man arrives, dressed distinctly, wearing a Triangle pendant

Casts speak with dead

Asks some questions

One of them was  something along the lines of - “Are they trying to find out about Bart.”

He knew the guards and expected them to be on his side

After the session Mo mentioned that the old man we were trying to scam was a big boss and that the guards were on his payroll.
