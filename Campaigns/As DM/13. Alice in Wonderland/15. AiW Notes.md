Party meets Captain Cook (who has a spatula/whisk on either hand) and Peter Pan (who has a small frying pan as a weapon). They’re fighting over the Food Isles, for food supplies, ofc.  
  
Party’s supply of food only consists of whatever’s left of the tea party…which is now pretty much have been eaten by the denizens of Wonderland that are stuck in the greenhouse with them. The wonderland people will choose to follow either of the group -Captain Cook and his Pâtissiers or Peter Pan and the busboys. AND BE THROWN INTO TURF WAR FOR FOOD.

  

Captain Cook and his Pâtissiers 

Captain Cook is a man in his late 50s, with a black beard and glowing green eyes. He wears the usual pirate getup, though with the spatula/whisk twist. The Captain keeps a tight rope on his ship and is feared by his crew. He however, is more than just with the crew. He’s only doing his job as a Cook to get food for Wonderland’s trade. Their specialty is in pastry making, where they’d take the raw materials and turn them into pastries to gain more moneh.

Pâtissier 1 (Name suggestion: Cookie Albert)  
Firstmate, been with the captain for a long time since he was a wee lad himself. Have no culinary background but decided to follow the captain because he assumed food trading would be more lucrative. He’s a good shot. Pls be careful with his Eclair guns.

Pâtissier 2 (Name suggestion:Patty Cake)

Crew. Barks more than he bites. His specialty is with his double swords. He’s used to cracking nuts with them and chopping fruits needed for pastries. Despite his looks, he has an illustrious background in pastry making.

Peter Pan and his busboys

Peter Pan is into FAST FOOD. He’s trying to make a fast food restaurant and franchise it, so he’s trying to take the food from Captain Cook.
