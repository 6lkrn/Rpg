### Treasure Locations

# Unspoken Pact
The deities are quite distant from their followers in the Land of Mists 
(https://www.fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Land_of_Mists "Land of Mists"), and outlander priests and paladins will notice this void of communion even as they still receive their powers. The [Ravenloft Player's Handbook](https://www.fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Ravenloft_Player%27s_Handbook "Ravenloft Player's Handbook") (p.64) and [Ravenloft Third Edition](https://www.fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Ravenloft_Third_Edition "Ravenloft Third Edition") (p. 50) discusses some theories why this phenomenon occurs and some of its ramifications.

Look to the one who sees all. The treasure is hidden in her camp. The treasure lies in [[Madam Eva]]'s encampment (chapter 2, area G). If she is the one performing the card reading, she says, "I think the treasure is under my very nose!"

I see a kneeling woman-a rose of great beauty plucked too soon. The master of the marsh knows of whom I speak. The treasure lies under [[Marina]]'s monument in [[Berez]] (chapter 10, area US).

I see the skeleton of a deadly warrior, lying on a bed of stone flanked by gargoyles. The treasure lies in the crypt of [[Indorovich]] (chapter 4, area K84, crypt 7). 

2 OF COINS - PHILANTHROPIST 
Look to a place where sickness and [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Madness]] are bred. Where children once cried, the treasure lies still. The treasure is in the nursery of the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] (chapter 8, area S23).

2 OF GLYPHS - MISSIONARY 
I see a garden dusted with snow, watched over by a scarecrow with a sackcloth grin. Look not to the garden but to the guardian. The treasure is hidden inside one of the scarecrows in the garden of the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] (chapter 8, area S9). 

3 OF GLYPHS - HEALER

You will find what you seek in the castle, amid the ruins of a place of supplication. The treasure lies in [[Castle Ravenloft]]'s chapel (chapter 4, area K15). 

STRAHD's ENEMY 
Drawn from the high deck, the fourth card in the card reading determines the location of an NPC who can improve the characters' chances of defeating Strahd. (Some cards offer two possible results, A and B; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.) Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. 
This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action: Inspire. While within sight of Strahd, this character grants inspiration to one player character he or she can see. Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn't indicated in the card reading. 
For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC's behaviour takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary. 

ARTIFACT/JOKER 1 
Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems. This card refers to [[Riciavio]] (see appendix D), who can be found at the [[Blue Water Inn]] in [[Vallaki]] (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, [[Rudolph Van Richten]] changes his tone if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]]. The characters might think that [[Gadof Blinsky]], the toymaker of [[Vallaki]] (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are "old friends," but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a [[Half-Elf]] carnival ringmaster named [[Rudolph Van Richten]]. 

BEAST/JACK OF DIAMONDS
A werewolf holds a secret hatred for your enemy. Use her hatred to your advantage. This card refers to the werewolf [[Zuleika Toranescu]](see chapter 15, area 27). She will accompany the characters if they promise to avenge her mate, [[Emil]], by killing the leader of her pack, [[Kiril Stoyanovich]]. 

A. BROKEN ONE/KING OF DIAMONDS 
Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong. This card refers to the [[Mad Mage (Mordenkainen)]] of [[Mount Baratok]] (see chapter 2, area M). 

B. BROKEN ONE/KING OF DIAMONDS 
I see a man of faith whose sanity hangs by a thread. He has lost someone close to him. This card refers to [[Donavich]], the priest in the village of [[Barovia]] (see chapter 3, area ES). He will not accompany the characters until his son, [[Doru]], is dead and buried. 

DARKLORD/KING OF SPADES 
Ah, the worst of all truths: You must face the evil of this land alone! There is no NPC who can inspire the characters. 

A. DONJON/KING OF CLUBS 
Search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Madness]]. His home is his prison. . . This card refers to [[Victor Vallakovich]] (see chapter 5, area N3t). Realizing that the characters are the key to his salvation, he enthusiasticafly leaves home and accompanies them to [[Castle Ravenloft]] 

B. DONJON/KING OF CLUBS 
Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father's house. Curing her [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Madness]] is key to your success. This card refers to [[Stella Wachter]] (see chapter 5, area N4n). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind. 

SEER/JACK OF CLUBS
Look for a dusk [[Elf]] living among the [[Vistani]]. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return. This card refers to [[Kasimir Velikov]] (see chapter 5, area N9a). The dusk [[Elf]] accompanies the characters to [[Castle Ravenloft]] only after they lead him to the [[Amber Temple]] and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, [[Patrina Velikovna]]. 

A. GHOST/KING OF HEARTS 
I see a fallen paladin of a fallen order of knights. He lingers like a ghost in a dead dragon's lair. This card refers to the revenant Sir [[Godfrey Gwilym]] (see chapter 7, area Q37). Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honour of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]] can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. 

B. GHOST/KING OF HEARTS 
Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle. This card refers to [Sir Klutz] the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 33). If Sir [[Klutz]] is Strahd's enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points. 

EXECUTIONER/JACK OF SPADES
Seek out the brother of the devil's bride. They call him "the lesser," but he has a powerful soul. · This card refers to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] (see chapter 3, area E,2). [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] won't accompany the characters to [[Castle Ravenloft]] until he knows that his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]] is safe. 

A. HORSEMAN/JOKER 2
I see a dead man of noble birth, guarded by his widow. Return life to the dead man's corpse, and he will be your staunch ally. This card refers to [[Nikolai Wachter]] the elder, who is dead (see chapter 5, area N4o). If the characters cast a [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Raise Dead]] spell or a [[Resurrection]] spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male [[Human]] noble) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife's protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save [[Barovia]]. If the characters don't have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, [[Rudolph Van Richten]] (see appendix D) gives them a [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Spell Scroll]] of [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Raise Dead]] if he learns of their need. If they're staying at the [[Blue Water Inn]], he leaves the scroll in one of their rooms. 

B. HORSEMAN/JOKER 2
A man of death named [[Arrigal]] will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul. This card refers to the [[Vistani]] assassin [[Arrigal]] (see chapter 5, area N9c). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, [[Arrigal]] betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become [[Barovia]]'s new lord. 

A. INNOCENT/QUEEN OF HEARTS
I see a young man with a kind heart. A mother's boy! He is strong in body but weak of mind. Seek him out in the [[Village of Barovia]]. This card refers to [[Parriwimple]] (see chapter 3, area El). Although he's a simpleton, he won't travel to [[Castle Ravenloft]] without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing [[Barovians]], or to save the Life of lreena Kolyana, who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with [[Bildrath]], [[Parriwimple]]'s employer, who won't let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason. 

B. INNOCENT/QUEEN OF HEARTS
Evil's bride is the one you seek! This card refers to [[Ireena Kolyana]] (see chapter 3, area E4). Her brother, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], opposes the idea of lreena's being taken to [[Castle Ravenloft]], but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won't accompany the characters, however, until [[Kolyan Indirovich]]'s body is laid to rest in the cemetery.

A. MARIONETTE/JACK OF HEARTS
What horror is this? I see a man made by a man. Ageless and alone, it haunts the towers of the castle. This card refers to [[Pidlwick II]] (see chapter 4, area K59, as well as appendix D). 

B. MARIONETTE/JACK OF HEARTS Look for a man of music, a man with two heads. He lives in a place of great hunger and sorrow. This card refers to [[Clavin Belview]] (see chapter 8, area Sl 7), the two-headed mongrelfolk. Clavin serves [[The Abbot]] out of [[Fear]] and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If [[The Abbot]] still lives, Clavin doesn't want to earn his master's ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if [[The Abbot]] dies, Clavin doesn't have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he's willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clavin provides no benefit to the party without his viol. 

MISTS/QUEEN OF SPADES
A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]], near the mists. This card refers to [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] (see appendix D). She can be found in the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] (see chapter 8, area S19), as well as several other locations throughout [[Barovia]]. 

RAVEN/QUEEN OF CLUBS
Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him. This card refers to [[Davian Martikov]] (see [[../Chapters/Chapter 12]], "The [[Wizard of Wines]]"). The old were raven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd's tyranny, leaves his :vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, [[Adrian Martikov]] and [[Elvir Martikov]]. But before he travels to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, [[Urwin Martikov]] (see [[../Chapters/Chapter 5]], area N2). 

A. TEMPTER/QUEEN OF DIAMONDS 
I see a child-a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake! This card refers to [[Arabelle]] (see [[../Chapters/Chapter 2]], area L). She gladly joins the party. But if she returns to her camp (chapter 5, area ' N9); her father [[Luvash]], refuses to let her leave. 

B. TEMPTER/QUEEN OF DIAMONDS I hear a wedding bell, or perhaps a death knell. It calls thee to a mountainside abbey, wherein you will find a woman who is more than the sum of her parts.

###Strahd's
