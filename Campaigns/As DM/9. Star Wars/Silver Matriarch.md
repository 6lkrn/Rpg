|Barracks - This suite offers a single room featuring a number of beds and individual storage, as well as communal refresher stations (one for every eight beds), to house a number of civilians, crew members, or troopers equal to twice the ship’s suite capacity by size<br><br>  <br><br>Living Quarters -This suite features separate rooms to house a number of civilians, crew members, or troopers, determined by the ship’s size, as well as communal refresher stations (one for every four rooms). Each room comes fully furnished. When a creature completes a long rest involving this suite, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1. <br><br>  <br><br>Recreations Suite - This suite comes with a bar and lounge area, as well as multiples of each gaming set and musical instrument, and can accommodate a number of civilians, crew members, or troopers equal to twice the ship’s suite capacity by size. While utilizing any of these tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to checks you make if you do not already do so. If you already add your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add double your proficiency bonus. If you already double your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add half of your governing ability modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1), in addition to your ability modifier.Additionally, while utilizing any of these tools, you gain a benefit based on which tools you are using.<br><br>Gaming set or musical instrument: While playing one of the gaming sets or musical instruments, you can always readily read the emotions of those paying attention to you. During this time, and for up to one minute after completing, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to read the emotions of those you performed for or competed against.  <br>Lastly, when a creature completes a long rest involving this suite, they gain advantage on the first ability check or attack roll they make before the start of their next long rest.<br><br>  <br><br>Storage Compartment- This suite increases the cargo capacity on your ship by its base cargo capacity.<br><br>  <br><br>NavComputer- This modification adds a navcomputer slot on your ship and includes a basic navcomputer. Your ship is proficiently equipped for Intelligence (Astrogation) checks. A crew member can use their bonus action to make their Intelligence (Astrogation) check, rather than their action. Your ship can still only make one check per round.|   |   |   |   |
