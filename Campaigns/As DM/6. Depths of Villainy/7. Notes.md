Group gathers in a tavern in northern snowy island. Everyones confused as to why they are there. This is because we added zen and tauhu. Insane NPC Captain called Captain Silbar has gathered his crew on his hunt for magical artefacts. CREW: Mitsu, Level Up. Randoms at the tavern: Everyone else. Blaque immediately asks tavern maid for milk. Tavern is run by couple. Gilbert Thorro, an experienced adventurer and his wife Gisel. He asks for breast milk. Gisel is offended. He gets into a fight with Gilbert. Nearly dies. Is healed by the party. Blaque survives but is looted by the party as he lies outside unconscious. Silbar makes a plan, shows a map to the party that outlines the location of an artefact.

They head into the mountains. See a tree with bodies hanging from it. A man named Osei is doing a ritual where he feeds humans to a tree. They fight and damage Osei who animates the dead bodies in the trees. These bodies have no blood. Rasian throws an explosive at the tree, misses, hits the roots. It explodes, clearing snow and revealing living roots. The tree projects thoughts in their mind, screeching in pain. They take psychic damage. Universal fear and dread. They eventually defeat Osei and loot the cave nearby. 
### 9/12/21 Session 3

They leave the caves and head into a storm. They reach an icy altar. See a woman standing. The altar is decorated with purple ice. Kanna touches the ice. Sees a vision about an evil queen. the queen is leading an army into a valley, burning villages and killing people. The woman is not beautiful, wears a crown and has black eyes. Kanna takes crown from the altar and puts it on. Woman speaks softly, "So my watch is over." Tears streaming down her face. She disappears. Kanna can't take off her crown, hears a deep voice "I don't think so ". Captain accuses Kanna of becoming a host and tries to attack her. Kanna commands Silbar to leave her after listening to her host. Silbar leaves them. They loot the sarcophagus. Everyone sees a new vision. Same valley, massive city, large castle, decorated spires, camera zoom into highest towers, woman king of kingdom, giving orders to generals at a table, see map of the world, conquer more and more of the world, K’s face on the lady. On the back of the sarcophagus lid is written "Here lies the dark queen and her most loyal general.".
They head back to the tavern but one week has passed in the meantime. 

### 16/12/21 Session 4
#
They head to the ship. See a column of soldiers coming up. The colum is lead by Iulius the Judge. He is a member of the Magical Inquisition that are hunting down Silbar for this allegiances to certain factions that collect rare and dangerous artefacts for experimentation. They reach the ship and are greeted by Silbar's Second in command, a Warforged named Steel. Steel tells them about what Instructions Silbar had left and how to carry out those tasks. They plan to set out at dusk. Nearing dusk they see the  tavern has been burnt. Gilbert was tortured and killed. He revealed everything about the party. Iulius has strict orders to wipe out all proof of Silbar's wrongdoings. He will hunt down the party over time. The party teleports through an adapted Gate Spell. The ship can summon portals to anywhere else in the world. Have not decided weaknesses or cooldowns. They reach a desert location. Sail out to the coast. Steel gives them a map to the artefact. They head deep into the desert, finding a strange alien crash site. A weird building lies in the middle of the desert, its walls rended and destroyed. Most floors of the building are missing. They explore it finding dead bodies and strange artefacts and traps. They find a man named Rigo. Wears armour, carries strong weapons. He's an inter-planar traveller also looking for magical artefacts. They find a Doctor Who screwdriver and leave, barely escape the collapsing and self desctructing structure.

G: Easy to think we’re at an equal standing here,  

B: Your skills are better than mine 

G: Get down on the floor and beg, maybe I’ll change my mind 

B: Begging for mercy, thats not something I do 

R: If this man does not want to beg, allow me to beg on his behalf 

G: Look mister, I appreciate your kind heart, but degenerates like this don’t deserve to live 

B: I’d consider surrender but I’d rather you take my head than beg for life, drop pistol onto ground G: Listen here scum, I’m not gonna kill an unarmed man, pick those guns up

R rolls religion check, some sort of feeding/sacrifice ritual, not familiar, dashes behind a smaller tree

B crouches down, sheath guns, take out torch, some pepper box bullets, wrap some bullets onto torch, molotov, throw at base of tree, close to center, explodes, blows away snow, exposing living roots under the tree, screech of pain through the air, psychic scream “get out of my mind”

C Good job, must move on, walk downhill, mountainous peak, over peaks, big storm, cover entire mountain range, 

E “are you sure we’re going the right way?”

C doesnt reply, continues walking 

R pray to god, 

Howling wind gets stronger, light snow starts to land around, 

C asks anyone have cold clothing, no one cause ???

Tons of snow falls on the party, take buffeting damage

Limbs freezing, teeth chattering, C encourages and heads further, reach eye of storm

Woman standing in front, purple ice, storm raging but everything inside is peaceful

K tries to tear off a piece of ice, when K touches, a strange screaming inside head

NOT AGAIN

R Again. What's with all this mind probing thing--

Scene fades, see something else, haven’t experience,

Hillside, valley below, village burning, army marching killing burning people

Is that not beautiful, woman with crown, pitch black eyes, vision fades, K goes flying, takes 5 physic damage

Z touch necklace, take a tooth, cut self, plant the tooth and a skelly pop out, tells the skeleton to  protect him

A very surprised about the woman 

K how did you do that eldrin

E just shrugs his shoulder

C walks forward, looks at the altar with wonder, I’ve been looking for this for years, help me retrieve, piece hidden in the altar, points at the middle at the sarcophagus, handsomely rewarded for the risks so far, believe me.

Insight E, not lying about handsomely rewarding, 

Skeleton Elfrid, looks at party, doesn’t say anything

Woman back against us, 

E walks in with skely in front, K walks after push E a little bit

Woman singing song, in [[Elvish]]

K what is she saying, E she’s signing something, reply in [[Elvish]] to the lady, why are you hurt my lady, she ignores, she walks around the sarcophagus

Noticeable on the altar, a crown on the carving, woman is the same woman in vision, same as the one on the altar and the vision

K takes crown to wear, slowly move hands to grab crown, 

Woman stops walking, looks at K, K looks at the lady in the eyes and wears the crown

Woman speaks softly, so my watch is finally over, tears stream down, she fades away and disappears, 

K tries to take crown off, refuses to come off, “Oh no”, try harder, force and fight with crown, searing burn forehead starts burning, deep voice “I dont think so little girl”, crown disappears and sink into skin, “Do you guys know how to take off the crown”

Party sees completely black eyes, crown sears into skin, 

E [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Mage Hand]], don't come closer please

C you damned fool, what have you done, you put it on didn’t you, draws a gun and points at K, no you fool you’ve become a host and you cannot be allowed to survive

E, what host, what do you mean captain

C we can talk about it once she’s dead, 

ROLL INITIATIVE

Skely tries to grapple C, fails

E healing wound on K

T tries to shoot gun out of C hands, misses shooting the gun, but hits C 

C this woman is possessed by the dark queen, there's no saving her 

R yells at K “ARE YOU STILL THERE” “YES ITS ME, IM BLEEDING TO DEATH CAN’T YOU BELIEVE ME”

B asks C, “well do you have any proof”, B leans into C face, 

C “I’ll procure proof from her dead body”

R puts his hands into air “may the grace of matawhan graces you”, healing K to full hp, used up prayer

K “thanks [[Rasian]]” Mind chaotic, faint voices, not clear, can’t make sense of things

K tries to channel divine energy, but black flames rises instead “This is not the dark queen” Loose vision of inner circle, dim light surrounding the inner circle

L walks away, pretending to not know anyone

B see’s what's happening, first confused, pointed at C, but when black flame rises, points guns to K instead, 

Shadows part between K and C, voice says “Command him” K see’s a black shadow pass in front of C eyes, and the shadows disappears, C “you guys are right maybe violence is not the answer”, stumbles backwards, we should probably head back, aimlessly turn around and walks back the way we came.

E “So are we killing or not” C disappears into the storm, looks at K even crown burn mark in gone “Sit down and wait for 11 mins”, “Sit down for 11 mins?” “I’m gonna cast identify” “Okay I’ll sit for 11mins” Squish K head “DONT FUCKING MOVE” 

R prays while this is going on

K under Possession spell, 

Not affected by environment while in the altar, 

Party takes a long rest, storm faded away after the storm, K tries to scare E before he wakes up, just stands and watch E intensely

E “are you a pervert”

K walks away annoyed

E “you know you can just ask if you want me”

K “this is too much”

E “I have [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Dispel Magic]], want to try it on [[Kanna]]”

T & R “why not” L tries to grab K before she runs away, “You’re possessed [[Kanna]] WAKE UP” shakes [[Kanna]] vigorously “Your eyes were black” slaps K left and right

E casts [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Dispel Magic]], K hears a voice “you have to deal with these people one way or another”, K “how do I deal with these people” “I guess I’m better now?, nothing happened, I’m fine, I’m myself”

R “you say you’re fine, but god knows what you did to Captain”

T & E, rough knowledge of what possession spell does, projection of a soul into another creature’s body

To destroy, [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Dispel Magic]], whatever or whoever is casting the spell, E “I dont think my dispel worked, I think the spell is more powerful than that, or we can just kill K and grab the crown from her”

R “what if K is possessed”

K “how do I proof I am K”

R “better yet how do you proof you’re in control of yourself, or you can tell us what you did to the captain” 

Its quite strange that he suddenly decided to not kill you

Maybe he found his kind heart and forgive me, I never did anything wrong, he was the one who tried to kill me

E looks at L to not let K go

R not buying in K words

I’m innocent, I’m not not [[Kanna]]

E, lets loot the sarcophagus 

L touches sarcophagus, vision goes into everyone’s head

Same valley, massive city, large castle, decorated spires, camera zoom into highest towers, woman king of kingdom, giving orders to generals at a table, see map of the world, conquer more and more of the world, K’s face on the lady, 

None of us know the kingdom, do not recognise city or culture, we are in the same valley from the visions, 

E & R stares at [[Kanna]]

Original vision, [[half-elf]], new vision its K 

E “breaks eye contact, looks at magic item

K “oh look magic items”

E “so how long have you lived for my queen” sarcastically

K “around 40 years”

R “never knew we were in the presence of loyalty”

E looks at R “Yeah I didnt know we have royalty in our party”

K pretends know nothing, looks around
T uses geode, written in blood at the back of sarcophagus, in [[Common]], here lies the dark queen and her most loyal general (¾ uses) 

E tries to push K into the sarcophagus, but fails, E falls down instead. R helps E get back up.  

E & K investigates the area, no signs of people escaping or anything, no other footprints other than ours 

Tavern down south, barren mountains, was surprising, didn’t expect anyone to be out here, 

Party returns to the tavern 

Arguments about the crown as we travel to the inn, almost nightfall, sunset when we reach the inn.  

R “looks at K, what the hell did you do to the captain again” 

K “I didn’t do anything to the captain, he just left us to die” 

G “I see you guys made it out of the mountains alive”  E “some of us I guess, did you see our captain” G “Where did you find shelter from the storm, it’s been going on for a week” E & T “A week?” G “Is that surprising?”  R “You were with the captain before right? Do you know if he had a ship?” T “If he is, he would be where the ship was docked.” 

B puppy eyes at the tavern, G appears annoyed, I guess you guys have been through enough for the storm, let your friend in this time but if there's any more funny business, I’ll finish him off B glomps R, thank you dear friend, it's been so cold out there, no more funny business, yeah E perplexed by the notion we were in the storm for a week, asks gilbert for mead for the table but milk for himself, and hot food 

Looks at B, no you had alcohol and you did something stupid, cheese and crackers for you B I do stupid shit all the time, fill this flask of absinthe please 

G winters tough, only have beer,  

B leans back, hair draped across face, tears dripping down face, crying on the inside, genuinely in anguish or withdrawals? 

E casts [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Prestidigitation]] and wets B face and hair 

TLDR: [[Kanna]] got possessed, captain left Session 4 Gisel is Gilberts wife?!?! Find treasure, find captain? GO NORTH Lets go to the ship,  A column of soldiers march up the road as we head down it to the ship Party stands by the side the soldiers march along, Leader “You there, are you the owner of this establishment?” - too high and mighty for the peasants Pushing B out of the way, sneering continues to march, WHAT THE FUCK He is drunk, sorry for that, keep on with your business No, no, please repeat what you say B lets out hearty burp, man what a good drink E sorry, he’s very drunk, slaps B face B plays, along, pretends to be unconscious 

Continues along to boat, dirt and rock path, to shoreline where the ship was docked Wizard captain, so ship can be sailed with minimum crew, party is for protection/random missions On the deck of the ship is a warforge, gentlemanly, well dressed 

Introduces himself “Steel” my master has commanded me in the event of him not returning, to accompany you on missions Pulls out long scroll, I’ve been commanded to retrieve these artifacts,  

Do you know when your master is coming back, did not specify, is your master S, is he alive, he has not notified me, so he’s not dead? Haven’t seen him recently, saw him when he left the boat with the rest of the crew,  

Robot emotionless, does not think he killed his master Not commited, doesn’t hate or love the party, just wants to follow his list of orders 

R does the contract with the old  

Rewarded after everything on the list is completed 

Does the list have a crown, not available to discuss 

S, quarters below deck, sail at dusk, 

Sails snaps into place, ship’s moving  Smoke in the air, large fire at the top of the mountain we came down from him, forest fire in such a cold environment, Steel steps out onto deck, we will be setting sail, ships starts to pick up ship 

S passes over a telescope from his jacket,  

Look in direction of fire, birds fleeing forest, mountain steep, very top burning roof of inn we just left. 

B no all the mead, sweet delicious drink just like that, its just mead, eye patch- at once, heads downwards to the cellar 

B stumbles below deck, steels walks up to the wheel, hold on to something, its gonna be rough, starboard, portal appears in front of ship, sail into another sea, bunch of crashing glass, aaauugggh a dude fading away 

Hot and sunny, nearby shore,  

Adaptation of Gate spell, lv 9 skill, portal disappears after we moved to the other side 

Desert as far as eye can see, heat is just as horrible as the cold, S descends, we have arrived at the first location, please take the lifeboat and head to this location 

Head into desert, trek into desert, harsh unforgiving, time of day doesnt help, adapted, ruins structures, arrived at a strange and alien sight,  

Points to T, you will need to drink your piss, when the time comes you will be ready, that is how you survive, large foreboding and strange structure,  

B rambles on about drinking piss is the key to survival, knocks his head on the structure,  

T finds a gap in the wall, wreckage, alien and strange to us, strange and foreign metal, mixture of steel/iron with some other strange metal that is unrecognisable  

Heard of these, called alloy, Are you dying of heat stroke B grabs metal with his left hand, warm to touch,  

E “yo theres some big ass thing in here, I’m scared” B “aww what are you talking about, large alien skeleton on the ground, strange dying pose, tries to cover scream with gunshot but shout first  E are you okay B Oh my, some dust, must have been collecting in these old lungs of mine E hears gunshot and bullet ricochet, push [[Blaque]] into the gap T runs back and looks at E and B, B gets pushed in, another gunshot as he shouts, falls flat on his face, gets up, cursed, accidental discharges E you are pretty much a premature shot here B it happens to the best of us,  

Roof almost completely destroyed,  

B bloody hell is hot in here, I should be leaving here E no you go first B I got you covered E Lvl go in first, we’re scared Lvl, flexes his muscles, I’ll do it, look for loot, empty corridor B breaths down L back, hands shake, me scared funny rookie 

Skeleton been there for awhile,  B thinks it may be a sand crackelor, cunning predator, burrows under the sand Opens up the jaw of skeleton, skull almost falls apart, a gap in the side of its face, cleaved cleanly with a weapon, heavy blow, axe or large sword,  B I dont think this creature are our biggest worry here E in the territory of a giant or titan, a gap but filled with debri, can’t see anything but hears crackling sounds, dont break your back L dont worry, flexes muscles, kisses both arms, I can do it, sweating struggling, opens up a small path, byeeeee Cog up to shin, purple cloak, 3x our height, big eyepatch cloth,  A lot more [[human]],  E I think we’re in the territory of giants, this looks humanoid B I think you’re right, I highly recommend we leave right this instant E identifies of cloak is artifact  B tries to clear the debri on top, cooking pan, crush some nuts and crackers, blend with gunpowder, douse rope, stumbles on the landing, lights up cigarette, runs down to the rest of the party Ear rending sound,  Humming gets louder,  B how beautiful is my job, did you guys hear that? Bites pepper box ball, pops a random bottle of mead, kisses his right pistol, dip,  Shrapnel everywhere, hinges gone, beautiful gap through the wall E this is nothing, we have to find another part to it,  

Exposed pipe under floor, purple lightning/electricity, humming a lot louder, electricity racing through the pipes, metal platform, lower down on the floor 

B lights torch, drops it down, hits a gear, continues to drop, another level under the gears, stretches a little, goes completely deaf for a moment, dodging bullet was boring, lets do something else, 15 feet across hole, then falls down, grab onto a pipe, hanging, electricity jumping between gears, hasn’t touched yet 

How’s the air, a bit dusty, good exercise, I’ll be back up, do you need some help, or would you rather try something else,  

Tiling on the bottom floor, no metal pipes, flinch, electric hits nearby pipe,  10-12 feet below,  

That was good exercise, you actually almost made it across, how hurt are you, tis but a scratch, burn scar up left calve,  

A, dont pull rope, just hold, tie to belt, haven’t flew for a long time, electric on the bottom scares me, may be a start of a new phobia for me, Kisses muscles, E rubs L muscles, bless, I’ll try, might accidentally pull it,  

Tie rope real tights, on other side,   L and B falls into gap, land on large gears,  

E “I FOUND BONES, DRAGONS” R “Dragon bones, huh?” 

Large dead body in a glass chamber, spilling out,  

Tentacle not moving 

No electricity, lid comes loose, gas leaks out into air, choke on putried horrible air, choking, disadvantaged roll 

B “absinthe?” “there’s an opening here, small metal cylinder in the mouth, grabs thing, jumps outside with T Rest of party climbs back through the rope 

B & T walks around perimeter, finds gap in wall to go back inside 

E sees platform, no electricity change, same level, gears turning, high pitched whine, R follows through 

Man in white armor, staring at drums, electric coming from, “generators”, looks R, eyes blue and glowing, “what are you doing here”, right hand blue glowing sword,  

Closed black cylinder, puzzle box, R excuse us sir, we stumbled our way here  “Quite a sight to stumble upon no?” Ignoring us, somewhere in the desert  Undisturbed, valved, perfectly enclosed with the poisoned gas,  R how long have you been here “It's hard to tell time with this desert heat. One or 2, well I’ve got friends now” L offers food “Thanks for your kindness but I’m quite full right now” L what did you eat “Well obviously food, no?” Suit falls apart, no body inside, just gears, blood does not belong to the dead body “I need your help to figure out what these are” E Why do you want help, what are you planning to do “I presume they power the place, can’t go underground until the electricity is turned off, are you not curious” E who are you “My apologies, my name is Rigo, I’ve been quite rude, I like collecting artifacts and other curiosities, desert place appeared out of nowhere” 

E not control panel but is where power is coming from T what else have you tried to do with the canisters “Are you crazy, its the source of the electricity” R Pardon me, did you come here via the platform outside “Just found my way through the desert, if you guys help me explore this place, I’ll share whatever we find, 50/50, we must stick together, I’ll let you have your pick” R that's very generous of you, asking E you reckon there’s other platforms, keep an eye out, don’t see any E we need your expertise B B passes R, mommy? Sorry, turns away R oh its fine B alright what do you need doc 

A turns valve, high pitch screaming through the entire building, all the hairs stand up, electric surges through the building, once stop turning the valve, electric stops and fades away 

L turns open vault, can’t push open,  

Have you hurt anyone on the way here Maybe one or two people,  Dead bodies could be yours, but it's okay 

Meh whatever I think I’ll work, lights a cigarette, not working, finally sparks up, drops cigarette, lits fuse  There's a reason I kept you alive 

Artifact, weird screwdriver, multipurpose tool, another buzz,  Magical effect activated, metal wall shift, starts to come alive, wall starts reaching inm Rigo missing 

Other generator turned off as well,  

Metal pieces, attack, perfectly dodged,  

Walking towards the vault, sees Rigo walking inside,  

Electricity faded, walls come alive, picks up [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Equipment|equipment]], helmet and a sword, puts helm on head and turns, should probably leave  

Turn to watch, walls eat the structure, disappears, doesn’t look like it's ever been there 

Session 5 E “So what now Mr.Rigo” Rigo “On my way back to my hometown, could not have done this without you” E “I’m beat, return to ship?” “I think this is it? Tried to identify, I think this is it” T “Yeah lets return” [[Blaque]] : What do you suppose it is? "Any idea?" E “Dont know what it is, artifact for sure, other than that don’t know what it is” B "Hm....intrigueing" S “you have done this task appropriately, may i please have the artifact?” E tosses artifact at him S “Please rest and recuperate, food has already been prepared” B tries to ??
