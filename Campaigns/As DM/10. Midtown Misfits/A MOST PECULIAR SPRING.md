A MOST PECULIAR SPRING

Winter’s over and the snow blanketed grounds are slowly replaced with green grass and beautiful flowers. School is reopened. The kids return from their winter break to new beginnings and new stories.

The school library, as well, gained a new beginning in the form of a generous book donation by an unknown benefactor. Most of the books are normal run-of-the-mill books fit for a school. One book, however, stood out more than the others.

The book’s not for check out though, as it can be seen often with the librarian Mrs. Huda Hefzy. Ever since the librarian had the book, she began to act strange. However, the other adults dismissed it as her missing her late daughter and discouraged the kids from talking about it.

Rumours about the book prevailed, though. Especially because Mrs. Huda Hefzy hasn’t changed back to her usual self. 

*kids could be helping the librarian or was punished to stay at the library or was taken to the library*
