MIDTOWN MISFITS: THE SUMMER CAMP

  

# The Summer Camp

It is summer holiday! Both the elementary and secondary schools’ directors of the town plan to organize an outdoor summer camp jointly in the woods that brings the children of all ages together, so they may befriend each other and make good childhood memories before the elementary students eventually transition into the only secondary school in town and study with their seniors. The children will be spending a few days in the camp, exploring the woods and participating in activities under their teachers’ supervision. Although there are all sorts of scary rumors about the woods, they are unlikely to be true, so don’t worry about it too much, kids!

  

# The Truth

A mysterious power has torn the dimension apart, spawning a red glowing portal, connected to an unknown plane of existence, in the middle of nowhere deep in the same woods where the summer camp is set outskirts. The location of this portal has yet to be discovered, giving it enough time to let an unknown elk-like creature out of the portal, allowing it to freely roam around the woods while the summer camp is being established. The intention of this creature is unrevealed, but it is most certain that it will bring chaos, and probably death, to the summer camp where nobody sees it coming, maybe except the Kids.

- One of the students is attacked by the bear and falls sick immediately, so they have to be hospitalized.

- The kids see a giant deer-like creature dangling what seems to be a dead human from its mouth.
