Party discovered a new muddy path and eventually reached a new area - Bjork & Kreeg discovered a chamber with a knight statue on each side - the duo found a half dying human with his hands chained to the wall - Kreeg destroyed the chain to free the severely damaged man, named Gilbert - Kreeg walked into the path down the chamber and started a fight against the dark cult member wearing a robe, and his guards - Chase burned guards as well as Kreeg & Bjork - Skipz hopped around on guardsâ€™ heads - party eventually killed the enemies while a few ran away - Musang fainted and nearly died but saved by Doctor Maggina - party came through a room with tortured/sacrificed/terrible looking corpse on table - Kreeg carried Gilbert up - moved on to discovered more paths and one of them was so narrow Kreeg could not fit in - Chase walked across the narrow path vertically and opened the door in the end, releasing poisonous gas and accidentally killed Gilbert on the other side of the narrow path - May Gilbert rest in peace - Discovered a secret chamber, covered with muddy water as usual - retrieved a bladeless hilt from a stone altar and carried it out - accidentally activated a lightsaber out of it and eventually claimed by its rightful owner Bjork - congratulation and session end!
