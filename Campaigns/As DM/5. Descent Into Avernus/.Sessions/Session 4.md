# 30 May	

Party moved on and came across three skeletons in the next chamber, infernal writing on the wall saying “Rise & Be Counted”. - Chase says the command, animating the team of 3 skeletons.
They walked deeper into the dungeon and discovered four doors, 3 crypts on the side and 1 room at the end of path.
2 of the crypts are empty and the 3rd contains zombies that the party fights and defeats.
Story - Chase dumb dumb and opened the third door, knowing it was a bad idea (investigated and sound inside) - Chase burns the zombies inside - closes the door and held it until it was broken down by zombies - Kreeg slayed some zombies - eventually eliminated all zombies and party takes a break inside

The party rests the unconscious tiefling in the first room and guarded by skeletons for her protection.
