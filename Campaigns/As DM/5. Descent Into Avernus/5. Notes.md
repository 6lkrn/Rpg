Summary on [[Chase]]/[[Skips]] side: (More detailed)

[[Chase]]/[[Skips]] and [[Bjork]]/[[Maggina]] don't know each other at this moment yet.

Chase and [Skips](Skips.md) arrived the city and aware of city mercenary called [Flaming Fists](Flaming%20Fists.md)(FF) - local civilians very wary and carry weapons even - [[Chase]]/[[Skips]] went to job board - taken a quest to look for a lost cat - met the forgetful cat owner old lady - decided to bring her a random new cat as her lost one - [Skips](Skips.md) stopped a conflict between FF and civilians by casting [Darkness](Campaign%20Resources/Magic/Spells/Darkness.md) - befriended FF's [[Captain Lewis]] - found stray cat and sent it back at cat lady's place - discovered she actually has an invisible cat in house - [[Chase]] made it glow and cat lady rewarded them - went back to find FF's Cap Lewis and asked about city - heard about demons/devils - proceeded to the inn for more infos - [[Skips]] showed [[Chase]] illusions of what he heard from inn people - asked barkeeper if he knows about any dark religion - suggested to meet [[Tarina]] (double agent)

This is where two teams finally meet.

[[Tarina]] gave a quest to the team to investigate the dark cult - group of pirates came in and caused troubles - the leader threatened [[Tarina]] - [[Skips]] casted [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Darkness]] (his favourite spell I assume) to blind most pirates - intense fight! - half pirates dead and the others escaped - talked to [[Tarina]] again about the quest.
