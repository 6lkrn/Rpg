- up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well  (actually the outer shell of a sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under the city. A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. More information about this entrance to Undermountain can be found in Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage. The upper floors of the Yawning Portal contain comfortable nicely appointed rooms for guests. Durnan, the proprietor, charges standard prices for food, drink, and lodging (see chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook for costs).
    

# Factions

## BREGAN D 'AERTHE

- A character must be a drow, preferably a male, to join this faction.
    
- A company of mercenaries made up of castaways of destroyed drow houses. 
    
- The leader, Jarl, is always looking for new members to fill the ranks, and loyalty is what matters to him most.
    
- Almost all Bregan D'aertbe members are male because female drow rarely condescend to take orders from a male. 
    
- A female drow can earn a place in the faction by decrying the drow matriarchy and convincing Jarl that she would be an asset to the brotherhood.
    
- Jarl employs non-drow operatives as well, none of whom know they're working for him; they aren't considered members of the faction.
    
- Bregan D'aerthe is using one of Jarlaxle's legitimate business enterprises, the Sea Maidens Faire as a front. 
    
- The Faire consists of three carnival ships (the Eyecatcher, the Heartbreaker, and the Hell raiser) crewed by disguised drow and a host of non-drow performers (musicians, acrobats, actors and the like). The ships' cargo consists mostly of wagons and floats that can be hastily assembled and paraded through the city. The drow use these parades to draw attention away from their illicit activities.
    
- He relies on three drow gunslingers- Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, and Soluun Xibrindas to do most of his dirty work in the city.
    
- Bregan D'aerthe is skilled at infiltrating criminal organizations. Xanathar's drow advisor. Nar'I Xibrindas, is actually a Bregan D'aerthe spy.
    

  

Bregan D'aerthe support comes in these ways:

- The adventurers receive small, unmarked black pouches of coins from an anonymous source.
    
- The adventurers receive an invitation to dine with Zardoz Zord aboard his flagship, during which Jarl takes their measure and offers assistance if they impress him.
    
- Bregan D'aerthe members buy off or quietly dispose of individuals who threaten the adventurers (usually without asking).
    

## EMERALD ENCLAVE

- A character must demonstrate an interest in protecting nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave.
    
- Druids and rangers are especially welcome.
    
- Cainari harbors a few members of the faction which seeks to foster harmony between nature and civilization.
    
- Members living in Cainari help guard the city against unnatural threats, including aberrations and undead. 
    
- They also watch over the City of the Dead (Cainari's public cemetery) and the city's parks.
    
- Members of the Emerald Enclave can be found in Phaulkonmere, a noble villa in the Southern Ward. and at the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery in Undercliff.
    
- The walls of Phaulkonmere enclose fabulous gardens, and the buildings are covered with moss and ivy. The place is owned by descendants of two wealthy families, the Tarms (longtime Cainariians) and the Phaulkons (who are of Cormyrean descent). They spend most of the year traveling abroad and entrust the estate to a half-elf groundskeeper named Melannor Fellbranch. 
    
- He is joined by Jeryth Phaulkon, a noblewoman turned demi-god who serves Mielikki, divine lady of the forest.
    
- The Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery is run by the Snobeedle family of halftings, among them an old druid named [[Blossom]] Snobeedle. [[Blossom]]'s youngest son, Dasher, disappeared in Cainari about six months ago. He was infected with lycanthropy and is now a member of a wererat gang called the Shard Shunners.
    

  

Emerald Enclave support comes in these ways:

- Enclave members share information they've gathered from magical conversations with animals in the city.
    
- Melannor Fellbranch provides free food and care for the adventurers' animals at Phaulkonmere.
    
- One adventurer receives a supernatural charm bestowed by Jeryth Phaulkon 
    

## FORCE GREY

- To join Force Grey, one must first become a member of the Gray Hands.
    

- An individual who has served in the City Watch or the City Guard is eligible to join, as are characters who are willing to swear oaths to defend Cainari, its citizens, and its laws with their lives.
    
- Adventurers who show promise might be invited to join the Gray Hands, a faction overseen by the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr. 
    
- Members of the Gray Hands complete assignments dictated by Vajra.
    
- Force Grey is an elite cadre of specialized adventurers, drawn from the ranks of the Gray Hands, whose fighting prowess is matched only by their loyalty to the city. 
    
- Force Grey attracts the best of the best. 
    
- Characters don't begin their adventuring careers as members of Force Grey, but they can work up to that status. 
    
- Whenever Cainari has a problem that can't be handled by diplomats or the city's other armed forces. 
    
- The Patriarch has the option to mobilize Force Grey.
    
- Such action is usually taken as a last resort, since some past members of the group have exhibited a tendency to indulge in wanton violence, causing as much damage as they ostensibly prevent.
    
- Although the Patriarch sets mission goals and parameters whenever the unit is activated, the Force Grey team needed to complete any given assignment is made up of individuals handpicked by the Blackstaff.
    
- If members of Force Grey (and, in some cases, the Gray Hands) are arrested for a crime, the Patriarch or the Blackstaff will usually intervene on their behalf and facilitate their release.
    

  

Force Grey support comes in these ways:

- Adventurers who are arrested are released under the loose supervision of Vajra Safahr.
    
- The adventurers receive a helpful uncommon or rare magic item that they're allowed to use for a time (until it mysteriously disappears).
    
- Meloon Wardragon or some other respected member of Force Grey helps the adventurers out of a tough situation.
    

## HARPERS

- Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Cainari. Bards and wizards are especially welcome.
    
- Harpers are altruists who work behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evil tyrants. In the current situation, it doesn't take long for them to suspect that the Zhentarim is wholly or partially responsible for the escalation of violence in Cainari. 
    
- Harper spies might use the adventurers as instruments to get at the truth. 
    
- Various nobles and guild masters in the city are Harper sympathizers.
    
- The Harpers have several secret gathering places in Cainari, among them Ulbrinter Villa, an estate located on Delzorin Street between Vhezoar Street and Brondar's Way, in the North Ward Oust south of Trollskull Alley). 
    
- The elf lady of the house, [[Remallia Haventree]] ("Remi" to her friends), the widow of Lord Arthagast Ulbri nter, is a high-ranking member of the faction. 
    
- Other key members include Renaer Neverember, the estranged son of Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], and Mirt, an advisor to Patriarch [[Laeral Silverhand]].
    
- Harpers prefer to conduct their business in bustling inns and taverns such as the Yawning Portal, or in quiet locations such as the City of the Dead.
    

  

Harper support comes in these ways:

- The Harpers make common and uncommon potions and scrolls available to the adventurers at a reduced or deferred cost depending on the circumstances.
    
- [[Remallia Haventree]] feeds useful bits of information to the adventurers and might also offer them temporary shelter.
    
- If the adventurers are accosted and overwhelmed, one or more Harpers come to their rescue. A Harper rescue team usually consists of a bard or a mage, plus 1d4 + 3 spies or veterans.
    

## LORDS' ALLIANCE

- To become a member of the Lords' Alliance faction in Cainari, a character must be a Watcrdavian citizen.
    
- Those with criminal records can also join, provided they demonstrate their allegiance to the city.
    
- The Lords' Alliance is a confederation of cities and towns up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North, including (among others) Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Mithra! Hall, Neverwinter, and Silverymoon. 
    
- Members of the alliance must come to one another's aid in times of need, and the organization uses field operatives (diplomats. spies, and assassins) to safeguard its interests.
    
- Cainari is one of the most influential and invested members of the Lords' Alliance. Cainari's Patriarch, [[Laeral Silverhand]], uses spies to keep tabs on adventurers in the city, rewarding those who place Cainari's interests above their own. 
    
- Laeral employs adventurers as agents of the Lords' Alliance. among them Jalester Silvermane. 
    
- Laeral spends most of her time in the Palace of Cainari. Within walking distance of the palace are well-maintained government residences set aside for the use of representatives of other Lords' Alliance cities and towns.
    

  

Lords' Alliance support comes in these ways:

- City Watch officials are notified that the characters are on "official business" for the Lords' Alliance and instructed to provide support whenever they can.
    
- Mirt, a Masked Lord who serves as Laeral Silverhand's advisor, invites the adventurers to dinner at his dilapidated mansion as a pretense for sharing rumors and imparting pearls of wisdom.
    
- The characters are granted a brief audience with Laeral Silverhand 
    

## ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET

- Any non-evil character can join the Order of the Gauntlet in Cainari. 
    
- Clerics, monks, and paladins are especially welcome. particularly if they worship Helm, Torm, or Tyr.
    
- The order's mission is to seek out and destroy evil before it gains a foothold. The surge of violence in Cainari spurs members of the order to find adventurers who can help return peace to the city.
    
- An individual can be a member of the faction and also a member of the clergy or a knight pledged to a specific god or temple. Members of the order act alone or in small groups. 
    
- Some are Waterdavian natives; others hail from distant settlements and have come to the city on temple business.
    

  

Order of the Gauntlet support comes in these ways:

- If the adventurers require healing or other magic, a member of the order can facilitate meetings with local priests who worship non-evil deities.
    
- If the adventurers get in trouble with the law, a member of the order puts in a good word for them and tends to their affairs while they're incarcerated.
    
- Hlam might show up and help the characters in an impending battle.
    

## XANATHAR GUILD

- Anyone can join the Xanathar Guild, which, despite its name, doesn't have official guild status in Cainari.
    
- Before membership is granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves the perpetration of a serious crime.
    
- Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion,kidnapping a Waterdavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a hire-coach, or looting a warehouse.
    
- Among low-ranking guild members, rampant speculation goes on about the true nature ofXanathar. 
    
- Few have any inkling that their boss is a beholder, and fewer still have seen or spoken to the eye tyrant.
    
- Given that the faction is fundamentally evil, advancement is based on one's wiles or one's ability to dispose of rivals. Competition within the organization is fierce and often deadly.
    
- Evil characters can thrive in this environment, but the risks are seldom worth the reward.
    

  

Xanathar Guild support comes in these ways:

- Any member given an assignment might receive a monstrous bodyguard or assistant (such as a bugbear, a kenku, or a wererat), who has secret instructions to kill the guild member if they fail to complete the assignment as ordered.
    
- The guild grants access to secret tunnels and safe houses (hidden cellars) underneath Cainari.
    
- Xanathar might send a gazer to help (and spy on) an up-and-coming guild member.
    

## ZHENTARIM

- The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join.
    
- Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members.
    
- The Zhentarim is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit. It has long sought to gain political influence in Cainari, but the strength of the city's Masked Lords, nobility, and professional guilds makes that difficult.
    
- The Zhentarim in Cainari is a fractured organization. Those who support Manshoon want to destroy Xanathar and seize political and economic control of the city. Those who oppose Manshoon want to expose and destroy him before they are themselves apprehended or driven out of the city by the local authorities.
    
- Adventurers can't join Manshoon's cause, but they can join and receive aid from the Zhents who are opposed to him.
    
- The leaders of this branch of the Black Network are retired adventurers who have become business entrepreneurs. Their adventuring party was called the Doom Raiders because their specialty was plundering lich lairs (which are called "dooms"). 
    
- They are desperately trying to gain a legitimate economic foothold in Cainari, which requires making alliances with local guilds and nobles. Manshoon's war against the Xanathar Guild has thrown their plans into upheaval.
    
- The Doom Raiders consider themselves the true Zhentarim of Cainari. Thegroup's leaders are Davil Starsong (Master of Opportunities and Negotiations), lstrid Horn (Master of Trade and Coin), Skeemo Weirdbottle (Master of Magic), Tashlyn Yafeera (Master of Arms and Mercenaries), and Ziraj the Hunter (Master of Assassination).
    

  

Zhentarim support comes in these ways:

- Davil can arrange meetings with influential nobles and members of city guilds.
    
- Adventurers can procure discounted potions and poisons from Skeemo's shop, Weirdbottle's Concoctions, which is located in the Trades Ward.
    
- Tashlyn offers affordable mercenaries, either thugs costing 2 sp per day each or veterans costing 2 gp per day each.
    
- Istrid offers loans of up to 2,500 gp with an interest rate of 10 percent per tenday.
    
- Adventurers can hire Ziraj to assassinate someone, in return for some undisclosed favor to be called in later.
    

## PATRIARCH

- Undisputed leader of the City
    
- Became the defacto ruler after the collapse of the monarchy
    

## KING 

- Missing/Noone knows who is next in line
    
- Work on this
    
- Possible civil war/unrest
    

## NOBILITY 

- Group of landowners
    
- Have lost most of their power due to the patriarch
    
- Are no longer directly involved with politics within the city
    
- Newer generation of nobles is rising as people either buy or are rewarded titles, these often tend to be of other races and are far less strict about manners and traditions
    

## NOBLE FAMILIES

- Amycathra  - Specialises in horse breeding and training, cattle ranching, wine making and weaponsmithing. Family Motto - We trample our trouble. Used to be officers in the cavalry
    
- Margaster - Business heavy family that deals with land-based shipping and bulk goods trading. Family Motto - Nothing is beyond our grasp. Have a history of magic. 
    
- Phylund - Capture and sell monsters. They sell some as private pets and the more ferocious ones to gladiator schools and arenas. Famed for their adventuring spirit, they are more than happy to recruit or sponsor other adventurers, providing they can share in the profits. Family Motto - What you fear, we master. Some brave (or foolish) souls claim in furtive whispers that they are of low blood.
    
- Roznar - Once banished from Cainari for smuggling, slavery and other crimes, this house has returned after the patriarch took power and is trying to overcome its dark past and disgraceful reputation by focusing on legitimate business ventures such as wine making and gem trading. Family Motto - We fly high and stoop swift. 
    

  

## GUILDS

- Rich merchants
    
- Gained a lot of power after the disappearance of the king
    
- Many Guilds exist, which monopolise and control the numerous parts of society
    
- The leadership for these guilds is tightly contested and infighting is a daily occurrence
    
- The few that survive the leadership are tough and brutal 
    
- All practitioners of the art/trade covered by the guild must work accordingly to guild laws and rates, they are also required to purchase memberships and licenses
    
- Though together they control most of the city, their divisiveness stops them from ever consolidating said power
    
- The patriarch tends to leave the guilds to their own mechanisms, only making infrequent demands 
    
- List of guilds

## CITY WATCH

- A desperate measure put in place by the patriarch to bring some semblance of control over the city
    
- Lead by Baron Percival Hart
    
- Hart is trying to create an upstanding and honest policing force 
    
- He wants the watch to be more than just armed soldiers that break down doors and execute criminals
    
- That being said, the force is basically judge, jury and executioner for small crimes
    
- The legal system consists of educated magistrates and clerics of law and order
    
- Jurisdiction is a grey area and often multiple legal entities will resort to infighting and backstabbing
    
- Ranks 
    
- Constable
    
- Corporal
    
- Sergeant 
    
- Inspector
    
- Commander
    

  

The police is a new force. They are lead by a honourable and well meaning leader but unfortunately his subordinates are not used ot the straight and narrow path. Many captains maintain close relations with the gangs of the city, providing their services in return for a hefty donation to their retirement fund. 

  

Most of the gangsters arrested by the PC’s will be released almost immediately. If the PC’s complain, their complaints will be quickly buried under paperwork and they will be treated as outsiders by the rest of the force. They are not able to communicate with or reach the commander unless they have gathered enough renown. The PC’s can try to gather enough evidence to perhaps make a case in the future. They can also try to kicked these captain out from their jobs, though this will not go well. Public embarrassment, evidence of bribes and making them fail an objective set by their superiors or the gangs can be an effective technique. 

  

If the PC’s prove to be too much of a hassle, the captains will try to get them fired. 

  

Fortunately they can find allies and other like minded men in the force to help them.

  

Police Factions

  

Day’s Watch- Well armed and well bribed men that keep the rich and powerful safe. Very corrupt. 

Nights Watch- Under Equipped and underfunded force created to keep crime low in the poor areas. City’s movers and shakers leave them to their own devices.

The Grey Force - Special forces that can only be activated by the patriarch in times of emergency

The Magestrium - Special Mage users that help investigate crimes

Scouts - Horsemen that keep a keen watch on the regions surrounding the city

The Dock Patrol - Semi-private force that police the docks

The Holy Shield - Volunteer paladins and clerics that defend temples and holy places. A loose organisation due to the sheer number of gods and beliefs. 

## ARMY

- Mostly commoners
    
- Meritocratic for the big part
    
- Many nobles lost their jobs as generals after the monarchy collapsed
    
- Usually posted on the borders. 
    
- Weakened, stretched thin. 
    
- The generals tend to leave the city to its own devices, living in hill estates or in distant military camps
    
- Ranks
    
- Lieutenant
    
- Captain
    
- Major
    
- General 
    
- Field Marshal

- Jalestar Silvermane - Jale is an agent of the Lords' Alliance who reports directly to Laeral Silverhand. The Patriarch of Cainari has asked him to spy on adventurers who might, through their actions, aid or imperil the city and its citizens. Since the Yawning Portal attracts adventurers of all sorts,Jalester spends a lot of time here, usually seated by himself in a quiet corner. Durnan knows that jalester works for Laeral and leaves the young man alone. Jalester is often distracted by thoughts of Faerrel Dunblade, his boyfriend, who was killed in a street fight last year. When not engaged in alliance business. jalester is lonely and looking for love.
    
- Jarl Baern - Jarl is a flamboyant, swashbuckling drow. He leads a renegade drow faction called Bregan D'aerthe, made up of disenfranchised male drow, most of them culled from destroyed or disgraced houses. Gifted with a sharp mind, a sense of humor, puissant skill with a blade, and a wealth of useful magic items, Jarlaxle is the secret lord of the crime filled city of Luskan. Jarl has forged an alliance with Lantan (an island to the south), and has armed his lieutenants with Lantanese firearms. He has also acquired a Lantanese submarine called the Scarlet Marpenoth to use as an escape. Jarl likes scheming. His current plan is to get Laeral to support his city and increase its influence, and failing that, to stage a coup with an alliance of Lantan, Luskan and Cainari Nobles. Jarlaxle has come to Waterdeep in the guise of a human named Zardoz Zord. "Captain Zord" is the master of the Sea Maidens Faire, a naval carnival. He spends most of his time aboard the Eyecatcher, his personal ship. 
    
- Kheban Aukai - The last king of Cainari. Worked to strengthen and build up Cainari into a powerhouse from a small port town. Grew up close friends with General Lefyr and Baron Hart. The two of them lead many campaigns into Faerun. Was believed to be assassinated by the Lord’s Alliance and was feared by the nobles for being too strong. Kind, but firm ruler. Loved Laeral. Has a secret bastard child, the next heir (Maybe one of the players?).
    
- Laeral Silverhand - Anamanue [[Laeral Silverhand]] is the fifth of seven daughters of the goddess Mystra. Each of the Seven Sisters is a powerful and ageless beauty with a penchant for arcane magic. She married Kheban Aukai, King of Waterdeep, the love of her life. After Kheben died, Laeral was heartbroken and vowed revenge against the nobles whose schemes had gotten him killed. Laeral's magic isn't as great as it once was, though she does her utmost to bide this fact. Only Elminster, her trusted friend and advisor, knows the extent of her decline. Despite her diminished abilities, Laeral remains a formidable, clear-headed wizard with plenty of magic at her disposal. She ousted [[Dagult Neverember]] as the Master of coin. She also stepped into the ancient Cainarian role of “Patriarch” a regency position until a new king can be chosen. Only the fear of her strength keeps the factions of Cainari in line. If they learn she is not as strong as she seems, the whole city would collapse into chaos. To avoid this, she is working with Baron Hart to create a police force strong enough to handle the potential outbreak. She is able to command the Force Grey, a secret and powerful organisation. Her agents think that the Grey Force has been operating without her permission. Laeral is reluctant to confront Vajra, the leader, on the matter, and rationalizes her inaction by framing it as a test of Vajra's competence.
    
- General Erdan Lefyr - Half-Elf General. Grew up in an impoverished, half-noble family. Studied in the military academy alongside Hart and Kheban. Was a gifted soldier and leader. Swore to put Cainari on the map. Won many battles. Was given titles and lands by his friend, King Kheban. Recently disappeared, presumed dead, but is actually trying to protect the true heir to the crown (either chao or Luca). Is not a part of any faction. The will names someone else as the heir. Adopted and raised a young aasimar daughter. Has the following honours. Charging Bull - Cavalry Leader, Baldur’s Gate - Commanding Victory, Prowling Wolves - Scouts and infiltrators, Lich King Campaign, The High Forest Campaign, The Dalelands Campaign

- Hob Stone - Lefyr’s ledger keeper. Drinks at the Broken Sword, a tavern for retired army men. Will help chao realise Luca is the true heir. 
    
- Luca Venali - Son of Venali. Can be trained by the party if they want. Could also be the potential true heir. 
    
- Manshoon - A clone of a once powerful wizard, the clone has many copies, all of who think they are the original wizard. The original Manshoon created the Zhentarim, and the clones still control some aspects of the gang. He wants to take over the city and replace the watch with his own mercenaries. He hopes to use the cities resources to destroy his rival Halaster.
    
- Mattrim “Threestrings” Mereg - This socially awkward bard performs at the Yawning Portal and is a better musician than he pretends to be. He's called "Threestrings" because he plays a lute that has only three strings remaining. His secret is that he's a Harper spy, and he's far more eloquent and composed than he lets on. He lives at the inn, where he spends his afternoons and evenings spying on Zhentarim agents and gathering information on other potential troublemakers. He recently befriended Bonnie and wants to help her doppelganger gang settle into the city.
    
- Meloon Wardragon - Meloon comes across as a cheery, optimistic, warm-hearted man eager to fight alongside those he considers his friends. People know that Meloon is a skilled fighter with ties to Force Grey. An intellect devourer in league with Xanathar ate Meloon's brain several months ago. Now under the monster's control, Meloon actively discourages adventurers from exploring Undermountain and urges them to focus on conflicts in the city instead. He also hunts down and kills Zhentarim operatives for his secret beholder master. He has his eye on Davil Starsong but won't kill the elf in plain view of witnesses.
    
- Miles Tealeaf - Sergeant of the Nights watch. Corrupt officer takes bribes from the Zhentarim gang in return for letting them off. 
    
- Mirt - Once known as Mirt the Merciless and the Old Wolf, Mirt made a fortune and carved out a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. Today, an older and wiser Mirt serves as one of the Masked Lords, a Harper, and a close advisor to [[Laeral Silverhand]]. He remains deceptively strong, vigorous, and clear of mind. Mirt has survived the passing of centuries by means of magic, and of all the Masked Lords, he is the least concerned with concealing his identity. His wife, Asper, passed away several years ago, and his rambling mansion has seen better days. Mirt spends his days embroiled in politics and whiles away his nights in drink and debauchery.
    
- Nihiloor - The illithid Nihiloor works for Xanathar, spending its days creating intellect devourers and setting them loose in the sewers of Cainari. Many people in the city have been possessed by one of his devourers and they spy for the mind flayer. Nihiloor has an alien mind, and it considers itself Xanathar's equal. It has no interest in supplanting the beholder, however, preferring to operate in the shadows and pursue its own fell schemes. His goal is to enslave the entire city and to that end he aims to sow chaos and to weaken the city.
    
- Obaya Uday - Obaya, a priest has traveled from Chult to sponsor expeditions into Undermountain, with the goal of bringing its magical treasures back to her employer, the merchant prince Wakanga O'tamu of Port Nyanzaru. She discourages low-level adventurers from exploring Undermountain but is happy to help them with her magic until they gain enough experience to be useful to her. If you plan to run Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage after this adventure, Obaya can take on a more prominent role as an advisor and a source of quests.
    
- Odo Heiser - Corporal in the Day’s watch. Studied in the military academy with Aerin. Bit of an ass licker. Wants to keep his head down and work his way up the ranks. Likes Aerin but wont risk his life for her.

House Phylund fund and shelter the Zhents coin and gain spies in return. They use these spies to plot against the Masked Lords. The whole cities know that they are strongly entwined, but what's not generally known is that Manshoon is in charge (even by the Phylunds). Orond is a short, stocky man who dresses well and is easy on the eyes. He has a boorish, inflated sense of self-importance, fragile ego, and despicable opinions about "the common rabble". Prone to excessive boasting and temper tantrums. Scared of being attacked and robbed. While in Yalah's presence, Orond becomes an altogether different person: quiet, almost timid, and happy to let his wife have the spotlight. Orond relies on Yalah to manage the Zhentarim. Although he is human, Orond was born with a tiefling's tail. The tail was amputated when he was a young boy, but the scar on his backside remains.
    
- Percial Hart - Commander of the Night's Watch. Graduated from the military academy with Kheban and Lefyr. The three of them vowed to put Cainari on the map.

She uses a silver raven figurine of wondrous power to deliver messages to Harper spies scattered throughout the city.
    
- Rosalind Clayten - A young Captain in the Army, she served as a magistrate under Lefyr, not actually serving on the frontlines.

- Saeth Cromley - Saeth Cromley is a retired sergeant of the City Watch, a likable fellow with a sharp, sarcastic wit. He occasionally comes out of retirement at the request of Barnibus Blastwind.

- Skeemo Weirdbottle - Skeemo became the Master of Magic for the Black Network, setting up a cover in the Trades Ward in the form of a cramped little shop called Weirdbottle's Concoctions.

- Tashlyn Yafeera - Tashlyn is Master of Arms and Mercenaries for the Zhentarim. In this role, she provides armor, weapons, and training to sellswords on the Black Network's payroll.

In that position, she watches over traffic that passes through the gate-and ensures that her associates in the Black Network can come and go freely. Born to a well-off family in Calimshan, Tashlyn bas an unfettered sense of superiority. Quick to anger, she hates to back down from a light. She  respects anyone who can best her in melee combat.
    
- Thorvin Twinbeard - Thorvin serves as Xanathar's chief engineer and trapsmith. He also serves the Harpers as a paid informant, keeping that faction apprised of Xanathar's plans as well as he can. Thorvin wears iron-rimmed spectacles and carries a large, heavy wrench that doubles as a club. He also carries mason's tools, smith's tools, and thieves' tools.
    
- Volothamp Geddarm - Traveller and misfit, joined the watch at the behest of Baron Hart, a personal friend. Captain of the PCs squad. Bit of a happy go lucky guy. Leaves at the first sign of danger. Enterprising author. Volo is known to most people as a braggart and a notorious embellisher of facts. Soft hearted man who loves his friends. Well known and well liked.
    
- Urstul Floxin - Urstul works for Manshoon, and he is the highest-ranking member of the Zhentarim squad stationed at House Phylund. Urstul is a glorified thug with all the charm and breeding of a snake, but the Phylunds tolerate him because he feeds them useful information culled from his spies throughout the city. Urstul takes his orders from Manshoon, which comes and goes by way of a teleportation circle.
    
- Vajra Safahr - Vajra is a capable wizard in her mid-thirties, the youngest person ever to hold the position of The High Wizard. She was handpicked for the job by King Kheban, and wields the Blackstaff. Vajra isn't the city's most powerful wizard, but she can hold her own. Despite her many gifts, she rarely makes a decision without first soliciting the advice of the Blackstaff, which contains the spirits of all the other Blackstaffs who preceded her. She uses both her own network of spies and Harper agents to keep tabs on things. Vajra teaches at the unseen university when she can. She is also in charge of Force Grey, an order of highly skilled adventurers who are called upon to defend the city in times of need. Scared of the increasing chaos in the city, she has been sending the Force out on missions without permission from Laeral. Vajra is always looking for new adventurers to fill the ranks of Force Grey, and she is particularly interested in those who can bring unique skills, abilities, or spells to the mix. The older and more seasoned wizards in the unseen university consider Vajra an upstart, but they are smart enough not to challenge her while she wields the blackstaff. Only Laeral can strip Vajra of her title.
    
- Victoro Margaster - The lord of House Margaster is a devilishly handsome half-elf who likes coin and power. He and his wife gained both by cutting a deal with Asmodeus which involved trading away the souls of their three children.Victoro is secretly a priest of Asmodeus. He is a successful banker, philanthropist, and worshiper of Lathander. Some of his business profits go toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But he is a self-serving beast. Victoro is well schooled, suave, slow to anger, and blessed with good health, long life, and immunity to disease.

- Wym - Innkeeper of the skewered dragon. Killed for helping the PCs.
    
- Xanathar - Xanathar is the name given to the beholder crime lord that lives in the dungeons under Waterdeep. Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The Xanathar Guild is made up of mostly monsters and non-human races as they are driven away from human organisations due to their alien appearances. Treachery within the ranks of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder’s favor and affection. Xanathar lives in a dungeon under Skullport. The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside from itself is a fish, named Sylgar. Whenever the fish dies, panic spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has happened. Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, its spies stole the Stone of Golorr, which contained information that led to the discovery of a secret vault. While he got into the vault, he could not beat the dragon. After the party stole the stone, he will do anything to get it back. It spends all of its time plotting against the dragon in the vault. The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere. And lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a spy or assassin. 
    
- Xoblob - Shopkeeper of odds and ends. Spied on by xanathar through a stuffed toy in his shop. Killed by the Xanathar gang for helping the PCs.
    
- Yagra Stonefist- Yagra is a Black Network mercenary who gets paid to protect a Zhent negotiator named Davil Starsong. Yagra finds the job boring and likes to pass the time by challenging adventurers to arm wrestle. If the characters express their opposition to the Xanathar Guild, Yagra might urge them to speak to Davil about joining forces with the Zhentarim to destroy the beholder crime lord.
    
- Yalah Phylund - The lady of House Phylund is no fool. She has a keen mind and the wisdom to discern friend from foe. Yalah stays abreast of events in the city, keeps a tight rein on her children, and uses her station and her family's wealth to pry secrets from the lips of nobles, guild-masters, and commoners alike. Yalah wants to bribe and blackmail her way into the Masked Lords’ ranks. From there, she plans to effect changes in the government that will ensure House Phylund's prosperity for generations to come. 
    
- Ziraj - Ziraj is a half-orc hunter who wields an oversized bow that shoots correspondingly large arrows. He is the Master of Assassination for the Black Network. If Ziraj sets out to kill someone, it's because one of his friends (Oavil, Istrid. Skeemo, or Tashlyn) asked him to. The characters might become Ziraj's prey, or Ziraj might come to their aid to eliminate a common enemy. He's the strong, silent type.
    
- Milber the stone mason

# STORY

## Chapter 1 - A Friend In Need

### Where to start

- After the party forms they are taken to the inn of yawning portal
    
- As they are relaxing, a fistfight breaks out 
    
- 5 humans are fighting a half-ogre fighter (pc might recognise her as Yagra) 
    
- The human leader is a balding brute with eye-shaped tattoos on his head called Krentz. Yagra is fighting for her pride.
    
- Remember how the characters deal with Krentz in this scene. If he survives, the characters might meet him again in one of the Xanathar Guild's sewer hideouts 
    
- 1f the characters don't interfere in the brawl, Yagra knocks Krentz out and is then beaten unconscious by his companions. Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal, points toward the door. "Out!" he snarls, and the Xanathar Guild members flee carrying Krentz's unconscious form.
    

  

### Troll and friends

- At the start of the 3rd round, intro the troll
    
- Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the tap room-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, "Troll!"
    
- Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover. Durnan draws his greatsword and springs over the bar
    
- He calls out to the players to douse the troll in lamp oil
    
- Yagra helps if shes conscious
    
- If they help Durnan, he says matter-of-factly, "You
    
- fought well."
    
- If anyone is knocked out by the troll, the employees save them
    

### WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?

- Volo is embarrassed to admit he might have gotten his friend Floon in trouble, and he resists providing all the details of what happened the night Floon disappeared.
    
- Beset by writer's block, Volo met Floon Blagmaar for drinks at the Skewered Dragon two nights ago. They drank and gambled for a few hours, and then Volo left.
    
- That's the last he saw of Floon. Unbeknownst to Volo, not long after he departed, a drunken Floon met another acquaintance, Lord Renaer Neverember, at the tavern. The two left together, with Renaer offering to walk Floon home.
    
- Five Zhentarim thugs working for Urstul Floxin jumped both Floon and Renaer. They took them to a warehouse in the Dock Ward, so they could question Renaer the son of Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] about the whereabouts of the Stone of Golorr and his father's hidden cache of dragons. 
    
- Before the interrogation could begin, members of the Xanathar Guild ambushed and killed the Zhent guards in the warehouse. The new arrivals mistook Floon for Renaer, knocked Floon unconscious, and dragged him away while Renaer hid and escaped their notice.
    
- Floon was taken to a Xanathar Guild hideout in the sewers. A small gang of kenku was left behind at the Zhentarim warehouse to kill any other Zhents who might show up at the warehouse. The presence of the kenku has prevented Renaer from trying to leave the warehouse.
    

  

### BLOOD IN THE STREETS

- As the characters travel through the Dock Ward, they come upon the aftermath of a bloody clash between the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim: 
    
- Chao questioned a bystander
    
- The skirmish that occurred here represents an escalation in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild. A dozen guards of the City Watch have arrested three bandits and are questioning witnesses while waiting for wagons to take away the criminals and the corpses. The survivors of the skirmish have been stripped of their weapons and forced to kneel with their hands on their heads. All three, loyal Zhentarim agents (employed by Urstul Floxin) are likely to be accused of murder. They coldly catch the eye of anyone who passes by, but the City Watch won't let the characters anywhere near the prisoners.
    

  

### OLD XOBLOB SHOP

- The shop is named after the previous owner. A stuffed beholder sits in the window, a fixture that is actually a magical sensor, through which Xanathar can peer whenever it wishes. The shopkeeper is a wizened deep gnome who spies for the Xanathar Guild. A few years ago, he survived the detonation of a gas spore in Undermountain and inherited some stray beholder memories. Driven by a compulsion to carve out his own domain, the gnome settled in Cainari, bought the Old Xoblob Shop from its previous owner, and tried renaming it after himself, yet everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. He therefore restored the old name and changed his name to Xoblob. ·'No relation to the eye tyrant hanging in the window!" he says.
    

  

### THE SKEWERED DRAGON

- The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards. 
    
- The Innkeeper is killed by the Xanathar’s guild for helping the party
    
- They meet and follow a clothes smuggler named Ralph Cotton. Ralph reveals that he used Floon to sell clothes to nobles. He too is killed by the Xanathars for helping the party
    

  

### Zhentarim Hideout

- These kenku are all that remain of the Xanathar Guild force that murdered almost everyone in the warehouse after the five Zhentarim thugs captured Renaer Neverember and Floon Blagmaar and brought them here. 
    
- Floon was taken away, but Renaer succeeded in staying alive by hiding. Now, the young noble is trying to figure out how to slip past the kenku, who are lazily searching the warehouse for loot while waiting to see if any more Zhents show up.
    

  

### The Watch Arrives

- Volo will use his contacts to find out about the tavern. He arrives around midnight and will deal with the kenku himself if the party doesnt arrive by then.
    
- Having rescued Raenar, he will escort him back to his father’s estate if possible. 
    

  

### Xanathar Guild Hideout

- Same layout as other Xanathar hideouts
    
- Xanathar has a number of hideouts in the sewers, where they operate
    
- Zemk (duergar) and Krentz (Bandit from the tavern) are trying to build a barricade to stop an ooze. Krentz hates the party. Both were killed.
    
- At the end of the hideout, Grum’shar is torturing floon trying to gain information and to impress Nihiloor (mindflayer) with his cruelty. 
    
- Since mo gets there early, they dont get the time to realise they have captured the wrong person. Angry at the interruption, Nihiloor orders his intellect devourer to possess floon and learn everything he knows. Grum’shar is an apprentice wizard. 
    
- Bartholomew (mo’s 1st char) dies. The devourer realises that floon is the wrong person and it consumes his mind, killing him before abandoning his body. 
    
- Both grum’shar and nihiloor carry stone tokens with a beholder symbol (circle with 10 spokes) which activates a teleporting gate.
    
- Since they both survived, they will remember the heroes.
    

  

### Completing Volo’s Quest

- Volo gives them the usage of Trollskull manor as a reward. 
    
- Raenar has many connections around the city. Especially with the harpers. Set up meetings with Mirt and Rema Ilia Haventree if the characters behave themselves.

## Chapter ?? - Lost Mines

  

Tale of Tragedy and Terror

A Deep and Creeping Darkness tells the tale of a mountain village whose residents went missing over the course of several months. The book presents a series of vignettes allegedly collected from “those who were there”: survivors, traveling merchants, and (in secondhand accounts) residents of nearby settlements. It is unclear whether it is a fictional tale, folklore, or history. The content seems factual, but the language is extravagantly dramatic.

Vermeillon, established after settlers discovered a platinum vein in the mountainside, did a booming business in both the raw ore and the refined metal for around a decade. Due to the rough terrain and the harshness of the climate, the village never grew large. It intermittently hosted a succession of traveling merchants who came to the village for a week or two, sold and traded their wares, then left again. The nearest civilized settlement was a three days’ ride on horseback down the mountainside. The inhabitants named in the book include Mayor Lei Duvezin, a kind and talented dwarf smith named Tormun, and his wife, Blenyss. 

  

Seventy years ago, an explosion rocked the platinum mine, collapsing the tunnels and burying workers under tons of rubble. Sixty miners were underground that day. Over thirty of them died in the initial collapse, and the instability of the tunnels made rescue of the others slow and dangerous.

The miners who survived the collapse were trapped for days or weeks before they were rescued—or perished in the deep, alone and terrified. Sixteen came out alive. Eleven were never found. In the wake of the catastrophe, another horror plagued the village as people began to disappear, starting with the survivors—not all at once, however. One or two would vanish in a single night, then a tenday might pass before the next disappearance. These unexplained disappearances terrified the remaining miners. After all the survivors either disappeared or died, other villagers began to vanish. The villagers tried to protect themselves by sleeping with weapons and taking shifts on watch, but nothing changed. Traveling in groups didn’t help, since a companion might vanish while even briefly out of sight.

  

With no one willing to keep the mine open and the disappearances leading to fears that Vermeillon might be cursed, merchants and other travelers

stopped visiting the village. The end of the patchwork story claims that the village is still there, though whether anyone inhabits it is a mystery. The volume’s writer muses over the decline of the village, speculating about the fate of its inhabitants. They wonder whether it would be worth hiring adventurers to see if anything remains of the village—particularly the platinum ore. Sketched on the back of the last page is a rough map of the village’s location, with directions from the closest mountain town, called Maerin.
