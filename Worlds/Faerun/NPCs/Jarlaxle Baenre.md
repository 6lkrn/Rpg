I do not, by principle, include any well-known characters from the popular books in the setting. You will not see Drizzt or Elminster or Farideh in this setting. And everybody say, thank the Gods. If a character from the books do show up, is for a reason.

Such is the case for the leader of the Bregan D’aerthe mercenary company based in [[Luskan]]. He's angling to become a part of the [[Lord's Alliance]] by spearheading the effort to include the controversial city into the faction, which is much needed since the faction lost two city members—[[Everlund]] and [[Sundabar]] and would much needed any shot of fresh blood. Neverember has visited [[Luskan]] and talked with Jarlaxle (albeit with someone nearby with sword at hand; Jarlaxle doesn’t have Drizzt’s good graces) about the move to include [[Luskan]] into the Alliance, but the other members of the group are still very wary.
