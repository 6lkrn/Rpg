A former adventurer who grew disenchanted by the intrigues and ambitions of the cities, he retreated into [[Kheldell]] and became their village wizard and main emissary with the [[Dusk Circle Druids]]. He spends his evenings studying and experimenting with magic, designing spells that are more customized than the standard variety. He comes into play when dealing with the [[Gulthias Tree]] Thralls.
