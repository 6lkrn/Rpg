I see Dralmorrer disillusioned from the Cult of the Dragon, but not any less fervent as a member of the [[Eldreth Valuuthra]]. He will continue his [[Elf]] supremacist actions and will be a general antagonist in any campaign that will use one. Just have his presence introduced in any means plausible. Maybe a wanted poster, or a roadside ambush, or have them witness an assassination, or even have them walk into a slaughter of an [[Half-Elf]] family with the mark of the [[Eldreth Valuuthra]] for example. Have Dralmorror Borngray pop in and out during the campaign annoying the party whenever the campaign needs to slow down somewhere.
