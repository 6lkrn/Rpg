The [[Triboar]] Trail starts at [[Triboar]], heads west, goes around the north of the [[Sword Mountains]], cuts past [[Phandalin]], and ends in the High Road.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunity:** There has got to be more than just a Mission House where the [[Triboar]] Road meets the High Road, wouldn’t you say? I'm thinking that there would be a village there that will deal with the intersection.
