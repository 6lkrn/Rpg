Since this is post-*Storm King’s Thunder*, and thus have no need to involve the [[Rod of the Vonindod]], I’m split between what version of Calling Horns I want, either the village run by the racketeering[[Tamalin Zoar]], or the quainter roadside inn run by [[Toaker Nightsword]]. Elminister verified Volo’s account of Calling Horns with Toaker as true, and such I’m inclined to include him in this setting. Since I have no campaigns in the [[Evermoors]] yet, I’ll file this for later.

(I might modernize Volo's version, just because)
