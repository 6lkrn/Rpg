**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** This can be of a basis of a Centaur-Human conflict that the party needs to deal with if they ever come.

I also have an idea that would provide a way to get them from killing each other. On Earth, there are tree farms, where trees are grown for the purpose to be cut down for lumber, firewood, and the occasional Christmas Tree. It should be no stretch for such farms to exist in Faerun, preferably near existing woods, such as the High Forest.

There can be a campaign where the Elves in the [[High Forest]] talk with the humans around there to set up Tree Farms to keep the humans from cutting down the entire forest. Of course, some parts of both sides might not want it and prefer open warfare for an “all or nothing” approach, which the party might need to deal with. I know the [[Eldreth Valuuthra]] wouldn't want to have any talks, and I know that some humans would think the same thing. So the goal would be to keep the talks form breaking down.
