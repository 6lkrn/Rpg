The Dancing Dell was a dell containing the [[Ladystone]], a sacred stone touched by [[Eilistraee]]. The stone was very old, possibly dating back as far as the early settlements of [[Ardeep Forest]].

The description comes from Volo: The Dancing Dell is a small, smooth bowl surrounded by a raised ring of earth, all of it cloaked in soft moss, short grasses, and ferns. At its heart is a needle of rock sacred to [[Eilistraee|Eilistraee]].

If there’s anyone who fears what's happening to the elves in this setting, it would be the surface-dwelling [[Drow|Drow]]. Some of them would still have bitter memories of what they’ve seen in the [[Underdark]] and were convinced that their lighter folk would’ve known better, blast [[Corellon]]!

One of the most vocal [[Drow|Drow]] critics of the [[Eldreth Valuuthra]] is [[Quile Veladorn]] , [[Drow|Drow]] Swordancer Priestess of [[Eilistraee|Eilistraee]] and one of the fabled Seven Sisters of Faerunian legend. Since Dancing Dell is a well-accepted holy place of the Dark Maiden, Quile took up shop in this region, gathering her [[Drow|Drow]] (and Surface Elven) followers to provide a bulwark against [[Elvish|Elvish]] Supremacy. She even reached out to [[[../../../Creatures/NPCs/Non Player Characters/Lord Darfin Flowshin|Lord Darfin Flowshin]]]], spurring up a relationship that either member doesn’t know what will come of it, only that they’re for a common goal.
