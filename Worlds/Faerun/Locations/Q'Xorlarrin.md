This is a former [[Underdark]] village that links [[Gauntlgrym]]  with the [[Underdark]] at large, originally built by Dwarves but abandoned and found by [[House Xorlarrin]] (who renamed it in their image.) [[Gauntlgrym]] wouldn’t even know of this village until someone went and steals the [[Dawn Titan]] from under their collective noses. Small wonder why [[Bruneor Battlehammer]] loses his church membership because of it. If I have any expansions to the [[Underdark]], it’ll probably start here.
