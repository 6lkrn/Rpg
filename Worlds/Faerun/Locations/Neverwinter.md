**Major City**: Neverwinter will be a good city for the party to rest up, restock supplies, upgrade [[Trade Goods|equipment]], and so on.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opprotunities**: [[Dagult Neverember]] has dealt with the Spellplague affecting his city, filled up the Chasm District (look for a major pit where all the needed dirt was taken), took down the wall, and opened the district up to anyone who would want to build a home there. If the campaign prefers a home that has already been built, there’s the Bluelake District, who has been recovered and rebuilt by this time. The Tower District (with the Shard of Night, The Fallen Tower, and the Clock Tower regions) is still in reclamation stages, and most of [[Dagult Neverember]]’s detractors, [[The Gnashers]]especially, reside there. [[Castle Never]] is still haunted, and probably will be forever. It’s probably has the connection to Evernight, no doubt.

**[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle|Teleportation Circle]]:** [[Sandyse]] may or may not have any desire to ‘join’ the Arcane Brotherhood. Maybe she’ll be an inventor who decided to set up shop in [[Neverwinter]]. Anyway, she’s keeping the [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle|teleportation circle]] in a row house in the Bluelake District, and wondering if she should move it to the quieter Chasm District.
