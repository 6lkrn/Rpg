Major City: [[Neverwinter]] will be a good city for the party to rest up, restock supplies, upgrade [[Trade Goods|equipment]], and so on.

[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle|Teleportation Circle]]: Everlund is where the [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/Teleportation Circles|Teleportation Circles]] are introduced. When the party needs some fast travel, have a Harper let them know about it.

Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities: I’ll introduce the *White Plume Mountain* adventure here, where a [[Dwarf|Dwarf]] from [[Sundabar]] researches the three intelligent [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons|weapons]] rumored to be in a billowing mountaintop in the [[Nether Mountains]]. The [[Sundabar]] dwarves have discovered the dungeon in their excavation, and some [[Fear|fear]] that the [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons|weapons]] might fall into the wrong hands—or worse, find their owners corrupted into becoming the Dwarven version of the [[Eldreth Valuuthra|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. A few dwarves then decided on what was formerly unthinkable and went to the surface to discuss matters with whatever few surface allies they have left.
