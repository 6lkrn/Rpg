When I read the first dungeon of *Tales of the Yawning Portal*, I just knew that I had to put it near a village that has those[[ Dusk Circle Druids]]. [[Fack Thundertree]] and Mount Hotenow; they have their own problems. *The Sunless Citadel* in [[Kheldell]] was an opportunity I can’t pass up.

Because of this, I’m going to incorporate Oakhurst into [[Kheldell]], with a regional hex grid will take the party to the dungeon proper. Its road to [[Red Larch]] isn't be changed from the cannon.
