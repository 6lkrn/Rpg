**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Who doesn't love those Hooty Bears? This small patch of woods (well, small on the Map) could make for a fine enchanted wood journey to some. Maybe an ettercap has captured someone baby brother and it's up so a group of young ladies to get him back, perhaps?

It is the area around these woods is where I will set up the *Against the Giants* campaign. It has Hills for Hill Giants, a Greypeak or Nether Mountain for the Fire Giants, and the High Ice north of [[Anauroch]] for the Frost Giants.
