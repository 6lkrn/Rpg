**Major Road:** This is a well-used road, so that there are regular Mission Houses and a [[Clack Telegraph|Clack Telegraph]] line along the route.

Two Bridges, one for the mentioned Blackford Crossing (a split in the route so that parties can go around [[Luskan]]) and the other over [[Raven Rock]], will be maintained.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: The two ends of the Blackford Crossing side route can have a village there. There is also the possibility of artic-based campaigns and encounters along the route.
