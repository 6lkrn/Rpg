# **DM Notes:*
**Vasilika** is a flesh golem constructed by [[The Abbot]] with the intention of creating an immortal vessel for the soul of [[Tatyana Ivanova]] Ivanova. [[The Abbot]] hopes that, by doing so, he can break the curse that dooms [[Tatyana Ivanova]] to always die before she reaches her twenty-fifth nameday.

Vasilika's body is pieced together from body parts of the humans who have sought [[The Abbot]]'s services. Her right arm is that of Burgomistress Anja Krezkova, given in exchange for the resurrection of her son, Ilya. Her left arm is that of [[Lilluth Chaemaer]].

Lilluth came to trade her arm when she, Fate, Stellaluna, Solaris, [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]], and [[Ireena Kolyana]] visited the [[Abbey of St. Markovia]], hoping to find a place that Ireena would be safe from the clutches of [[Strahd von Zarovich]]  and hoping also to convince [[The Abbot]] to resurrect the wereraven [[Dagmara Martikov]]. Upon realizing that Ireena had the soul of [[Tatyana Ivanova]], [[The Abbot]] sought to keep her at the Abbey, hoping to transfer her soul into Vasilika. Lilluth made a bargain with [[The Abbot]], exchanging her arm for Ireena's free passage.
