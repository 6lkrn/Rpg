Adrian is the heir to the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery. He and his wife Muriel have one child, Katarina. He is a gracious and generous man who does all he can to honour the Martikov family name. Unlike so many others in [[Barovia]], he keeps an optimistic and positive outlook on things, even during dire circumstances. Adrian works hard at the Winery, making deliveries by cart despite the obscuring fog and dangers found along the road.

**Adrian Martikov** is a Barovian wereraven and a member of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. The eldest child of [[Davian Martikov]] and [[Alma Martikov]], Adrian is the heir to the [[Wizard of Wines Winery]]. He and his wife [[Muriel Martikov]]  have one child, [[Katarina Martikov]]. In 1538 by the Barovian calendar (495 AC), Muriel went missing and was presumed dead. She was later discovered to have been imprisoned by [[Baba Lysaga]] in her creeping hut.

Adrian assisted his aunt, [[Elsa Martikov]], in helping [[Lilluth]], [[Fate]], [[Stellaluna]], [[Solaris]], [[Ezmerelda]], and [[Ireena]] escape [[Vanargand]] and his werewolves via the Keepers' secret tunnels. When asked about the dangers of [Berez](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Berez "Berez"), Adrian's daughter Katarina warned the party about [[Baba Lysaga]], but Adrian insisted that she did not really exist.

After [Strahd](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Strahd_von_Zarovich "Strahd von Zarovich") had the werewolves burn the Martikovs' winery to the ground, Adrian is missing and presumed dead.
