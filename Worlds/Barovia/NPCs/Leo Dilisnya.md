Leo was one of the soldiers who betrayed and murdered Strahd on the day of [[Sergei von Zarovich|Sergei]] and [[Tatyana Ivanova]]'s wedding. He escaped from [[Castle Ravenloft]], only to be hunted down and killed by the vampire [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. The Wachters keep his bones under lock and key so that Leo can't be raised from the dead.
