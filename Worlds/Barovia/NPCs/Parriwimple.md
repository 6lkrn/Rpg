# **Rundown:**

Found in [[Bildrath's Mercantile]].
Nephew of [[Bildrath Cantemir]].  
# **Description:**
A simple-minded, strong-bodied stock boy. 

A hulking silhouette steps forward from the mist—a young man, tall and brawny. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint in the moonlight. Though muscles ripple beneath his tunic, there's a lightness and immaturity to his posture that belies his strength and size. 
 
# **Character History:**
Parriwimples parents were killed in the seige of Barovia and he was taken in by his uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir]].

Resonance [[Parriwimple]] should inspire sympathy for the loss of his parents, endearment for his childlike mannerisms and optimistic perseverance, and flattery for his fascination with the players’ exotic weapons and clothes.

Motivations. [[Parriwimple]] wants to help his friends and neighbors, take care of his Uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]], and honor his late parents’ memories. Inspirations. When playing [[Parriwimple]], channel Lenny Small (Of Mice and Men) and Forrest Gump (Forrest Gump). 

Character Information 

Persona. To the world, [[Parriwimple]] is a cheerful, simple-minded young man. To those he trusts, [[Parriwimple]] is a thoughtful, insightful, yet grieving orphan, desperate to move past his parents’ deaths by proving useful to others. 

Morale. In a fight, [[Parriwimple]] would hold up his hands and plead for peace. If ignored, however, he would swiftly use his strength to restrain any combatants—with righteous fury if defending his uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]. 

Relationships. [[Parriwimple]] is an orphan and the nephew of the general-store owner [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] Cantemir.

# **Knowledge:** 
Parriwimple can share the following information with the players: 

Father Donavich used to be a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or a warm crabapple pie with visitors. 

Ever since the siege started, however, Donavich has shut himself inside the church and turned away visitors more often than not. 

Father Donavich hasn’t worn his holy symbol (a bronze sunburst) since the rebellion, which [[Parriwimple]] considers odd. (Parriwimple always loved how the light would glint off of its surface, and adored hearing [[Donavich]]’s son, [[Doru]], tell stories of how the sun once shone in [[Barovia]].)
