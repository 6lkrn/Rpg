# **Rundown:**
**Escher Belasco** is a vampire spawn and a consort of [[Strahd von Zarovich 1]]. Originally from the town of [[Barovia]]), he now resides in [[Castle Ravenloft]] in the nation of [[Barovia]] 

Prior to becoming a vampire, Escher was a close friend of the wereraven [[Fyodor Martikov]]. Fyodor says that the [[Keepers of the Feather]] "failed to save" Escher from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

> _"He always dreamed of better things, better than this place.  He was always smiling, even at the darkest times.  I promised him I would protect him, but I failed.  He tried to help us fight against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], but he was taken, and it was a long time before I saw him again.  When I did... He had changed.  I do not know him anymore."_

> -[[Fyodor Martikov]]

Escher first encountered [[Lilluth Chaemaer]], [[Fate]], [[Stellaluna Silverleaf]], and [[Solaris Silverleaf]] at the [[Barovia]] Church, where they had gone with [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]] to bury their father. Escher approached [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and demanded that he attend a dinner at [[Castle Ravenloft]] in order for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to meet the new burgomaster of [[Barovia]]. He also invited the party to dine with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

After the party's dinner at Castle Ravenloft, Escher and [[Gertruda]] set to accompany and guard the party. However, Solaris drew Escher's attention, and distracted him while Fate explored the castle. During this time, Escher also drank Solaris's blood. Calling Solaris back, the party then fled the castle with the help of Fyodor and [Dagmara Martikov](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Dagmara_Martikov "Dagmara Martikov").

Later, Stellaluna adopted Escher's appearance in order to speak with [Baba Lysaga](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Baba_Lysaga "[[Baba Lysaga]]").
