# **DM Notes:**
**Gertruda Stiegler** is one of the two current consorts of King [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] von Zarovich. Unlike [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s second consort, [[Escher Belasco]], Gertruda has not yet been turned into a vampire spawn.

Born in the town of [[Barovia]], Gertruda was always an absent-minded girl with dreams far beyond her small town. Easily charmed by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s romantic intentions, Gertruda was happy to leave her mother's home and move to [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Gertruda is thrilled by the beautiful dresses and jewelry that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has given her, and believes that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will soon propose to her.
