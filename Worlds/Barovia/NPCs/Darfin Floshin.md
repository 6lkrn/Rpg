Darfin "Longwalker" FLOSHIN

“Let me share with you a dream of mine. Where people can live with one another in peace rather than tearing each other apart. Where someone is judged by what they make of themselves rather than the circumstances of their birth. A dream of, where Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Barbarians, Halflings, and all the other civilized people can co-exist in peace. If what I’m saying is a mere dream, you might be right. But consider the alternative.”

The [[Eldreth Valuuthra]] may have some gains in this setting, but they’re not running unchallenged in the Realms. Calls to resist such anti-non-[[Elf]] rhetoric abound, none louder than one Lord Darfin Floshin. He is in a position similar to the Reverend Martin Luther King with his own “I Have a Dream” speech. There is a twist being that he’s fighting the racism coming from his own people, the Elves. He brings his voice to the still majority of Elves who don’t hate any other race, even the Dwarves who they find annoying at times. (Dwarves and Elves still do bicker like dogs and cats. You can’t escape it, even in homebrew campaign worlds.)

Lord Floshin has his part in *Scourge of the Sword Coast* as he tries to broker a peace deal with the elves in [[Ardeep Forest]]. This leads him at odds with the [[Eldreth Valuuthra]] who has managed to lure one of his own daughters into their fold with the hopes of taking him out.

He has help in the form of one of [[The Seven Sisters]] of legend, [[Quile Veladorn]]. Darfin was just as surprised at seeing her still alive today as he was feeling a common romance between the two. Does he dare fall in love with this Priestess of the Dark Maiden and ask for her hand?
