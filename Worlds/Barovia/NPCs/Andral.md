**Andral** was widely [worshiped](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Worshiped "Worshiped") in [ancient Barovia](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Prime_Material_Barovia "Prime Material Barovia"). The [Church of Andral](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Church_of_Andral "Church of Andral") is dedicated to his [worship](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Worship "Worship"). It was founded in [168 BC](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/168_BC "168 BC"). Its public face disappeared from [Barovia](http://fraternityofshadows.com/wiki/Barovia "Barovia") in the second half of the 4th century. [[Keeva Sixtywinters]] is his high priestess and remaining [[cleric]].

The name Andral is sometimes rendered as _Ahndrel_ or _Eundrel_.

Ancient ruins provide evidence for Andral's worship in [[Borca]], but like in [[Barovia]], his worship has fallen away. This is presumed to have occurred during the Vacancy of Power.
