**Daisy** is a [[Kenku]] child sent by the [[Consortium of Shadows]] to accompany Lilluth, Fate, Stellaluna, and Solaris into the land of [[Barovia]]. She is missing and presumed dead after the burning of the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery.

Daisy was named by the orc Garrag, her caretaker within the Consortium. Garrag introduced the party to Daisy when he brought them to the entrance to [[Barovia]], on the outskirts of Deep Harbor. Daisy traveled with the party to [[Barovia]]. The party, especially Fate, became very attached to the child.

The first time that the party fought the hags at [[Old Bonegrinder]], Daisy was badly injured, so the party sent her ahead to [[Barovia]] with [[Vasili von Holz]] before fighting the hags again. They left Daisy with Vasili again while they dined at [[Castle Ravenloft]] with [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich]], and then took her with them back to [[Vallaki]] and subsequently to [[Krezk]] and the [[Abbey of St. Markovia]].

At the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery, [[Elsa Martikov]] helped the party escape Strahd and [[Vanargand]], but recommended that Daisy stay behind at the winery, where she thought it would be safer. Shortly thereafter, however, the party saw Strahd burn the winery. [[Fyodor Martikov]] told them that there are multiple escape routes and havens outside of the winery, but he was unsure how many, if any, people had escaped the fire.
