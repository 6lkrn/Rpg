In life, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] Antonovich, also known as [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] the Great, was a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of the [[village of Barovia]]. In his prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honor. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] Antonovich was [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] Kolyanovich's great grandfather. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s father gave him that name in the hopes that he would one day become a great warrior.Â
