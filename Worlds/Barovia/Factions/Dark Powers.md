# The Cult of Ezra 

Some Barovians are neither wholly satisfied with the faith of the [[Morninglord]] nor depraved enough to seek the blessings of [[Mother Night]]. In their eyes, the [[Morninglord]] is a powerless or craven deity, unable to save his own worshippers or even raise a single sunrise, while [[Mother Night]] is a cruel and savage being, too dangerous to acknowledge or worship. 

These Barovians walk a middle path, and instead worship Ezra, the Mistwalker: the god of the Mists, or—as some suggest—the embodiment of the Mists themselves. (See Ezra, God of the Mists, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft at p. 64, for more information.) 

In [[Barovia]], the followers of Ezra preach that power is an illusion, and suffering life’s only constant. Many believe that tales of the sun are myths, and that [[Barovia]] has neither past nor future: only an unceasing present that must be forever endured. 

As an aspect of the Seeker, [[Madam Eva]] is bound to follow the rules of her divinity. She cannot refuse to read another’s fortune, nor can she share her foretellings with any but those who hear them. Many individuals, both savory and not, have therefore called upon her to see their futures—including, at times, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] von Zarovich himself. 

Given [[Madam Eva]]’s exceptionally long lifespan—far longer than any ordinary human—[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] strongly suspects that she is more than she appears. However, thus far, [[Madam Eva]] has been content to give him the foretellings he seeks—and he, in response, has been content to accept her sly smiles and denials. 

However, [[Madam Eva]] foresees that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will soon return to her for a final, terrible time—and that the reading she will deliver shall define the fate of all [[Barovia]]. 

Though she preaches devil-worship to her cult, Lady [[Fiona Wachter]] of [[Vallaki]] is a quiet worshipper of Ezra. Many turn to Ezra for comfort in times of tragedy, finding it easier to believe that hope is an illusion than to believe that it may be attained and then lost. 

Few, however, suspect the horrible truth: that “Ezra” does not, and has never existed—and that her soothing voice is merely a simulacrum conjured by the twisted whispers of the Dark Powers themselves. 

# Metaphysics & Magic 

The land of [[Barovia]] is a "demiplane"—a small, self-contained plane of existence. It is one of many Domains of Dread, which together occupy a small corner of the Shadowfell. 

Like all of the Domains of Dread, [[Barovia]] is entrapped by the mists of Ravenloft, as described in Mists of Ravenloft (p. 23), and ruled by the mysterious Dark Powers. The Dark Powers are nameless, shapeless entities that serve as the jailers of the "Darklords" of the Domains: evil individuals who have committed unspeakable crimes. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] von Zarovich is one such Darklord. 

Precious few—including only archmages, scholars, and (at times) the Darklords themselves—know that the Dark Powers exist. Fewer still know of their true nature and origins. While the Dark Powers were born from the miasma of evil that dwells within the [[Amber Temple]] of [[Barovia]], they are not themselves the vestiges—the non-sapient fragments of dead, malevolent gods—that are sealed within the sarcophagi of the temple. (For more information about the vestiges of the Amber Temple, see The Amber Temple (p. 181).) 

The Dark Powers do not necessarily seek to corrupt those they encounter. Instead, for certain individuals, they seek to offer a choice between darkness and light—and to punish and ensnare those who fall to their temptations. In this adventure, two such individuals are Strahd von Zarovich and Ireena Kolyana. 

As described in Mists of Ravenloft and Sunlight in Barovia (p. 23-24), the land of Barovia is surrounded by a deadly fog that engulfs any creature that tries to leave, and has not known the light of the sun in centuries. 

Spells cast in Barovia function as described in Alterations to Magic and Resurrection Madness, and may be cosmetically modified in gruesome ways as described in Cosmetic Spell Modifications (p. 24). While deities and patrons can still empower clerics and warlocks who make their way to Barovia, their ability to intervene directly—given the limited omnipotence of the Dark Powers within the Domains of Dread—is sorely limited. 


# What Dark Powers Want

Every villain has a goal. The Dark Powers, I figure, shouldn't be any different. Initially, I made them try to corrupt players "just because." But that honestly made for really poor planning and role-play. Here's something a bit more concrete.

-   My Weird, but Effective Fishing Metaphor
    
    -   Hungry
        
        -   Imagine that the Dark Powers are human beings who are immortal. However, they're still plagued by human needs, namely hunger. While they can't actually starve to death, being hungry is a horrible feeling and they're desperate for food.
            
        -   However, they can only eat fish. That's it. Nothing else in the whole world can satiate their hunger. There's just one super obvious problem: fish live underwater. And humans certainly can't live down there.
            
    -   Divers
        
        -   How do we catch the fish then? Well, we can dive into the water and hold our breath. It's not a terribly effective method, but we might be able to bag a fish every so often so we can eat.
            
        -   But even then, eventually, we have to get out of the water. We can't swim/tread water forever.
            
    -   Fishermen
        
        -   We might also cast a line into the water; use some juicy bait to lure unsuspecting fish into our clutches.
            
        -   In this way, we might attract a few easy meals. But it's hardly filling and not terribly consistent. Also, we have to do a lot of hard work that's not becoming of beings of our greatness.
            
    -   Recruiting a Shark
        
        -   This is where my metaphor gets a little absurd, but I still like it so whatever. XD
            
        -   What if we could instead recruit one of the fish to catch other fish _for_ us? The fish lives in the water, so it doesn't have that pesky breathing problem. And it's proximity would be much more consistent for a source of food.
            
        -   But how could we persuade the fish to lead other fish to their doom? What if we offered it a boon? What if we made it a _shark_. A shark would be sooooo much more powerful than the other fish, after all. And a shark would never have to be afraid of anything else in the sea. It would be a scary boss fish. And all it would have to do is catch us loads of fish to eat. Which it would already be doing anyway. Really it's a win-win. ;)
            
-   Translation:
    
    -   That's basically what the Dark Powers want. They feed on mortal souls. However, those souls only exist in realms in which they can't live. Sure, they can enter a mortal realm for a short time, but they can never stay. Every so often, they can reach out and corrupt a soul ripe for stealing, but it's hard work and doesn't happen consistently. Collecting souls through a champion (a shark) is a much better method of finding food.
        

Collecting Souls

-   Special Diet
    
    -   Each Dark Power has a specific sort of soul to collect to feed their hunger, usually based on their representative power. Fekre, Queen of Poxes, collects the souls of those who die from her pox. Delban, Star of Ice and Hate, collects souls who freeze to death.
        
    -   Vampyr collects the souls of those who die from insanguination (extreme blood loss). So, a champion who quite literally needs to drink blood is an excellent way to collect. Basically, anybody who dies in Barovia by vampire bite looses their soul to Vampyr.
        
-   Direct Causation
    
    -   Mind you, not every soul in all the universe that dies from cold will go to Delban. In order for a Dark Power to "consume" a soul, they must have some kind of causation. A fisherman certainly can't take credit for fish who randomly die in the ocean, after all. They actually have to _catch_ the fish, whether with their own abilities or through a shark/employee/champion.
        
    -   So, other vampires don't filter their prey to Vampyr automatically. It works as a sort of chain of command. Vampyr gets his souls through Strahd. Vampire spawn created by Strahd also get linked in the chain. But another high vampire totally unrelated to Strahd would have nothing to do with Vampyr.
        
-   The Soulless
    
    -   You can, if you want, interpret this as the reason there are soulless people in Barovia. While there were once a plethora of souls in the valley - so many so that there weren't enough physical bodies to house them all at any given time - now there simply aren't enough. Those who have died to the vampires in Barovia over the many centuries have lost their souls to Vampyr and the mists prevent any new souls from entering the land.
        

Prep Work

-   I would recommend that you tailor a Dark Power for each PC. Try to make an evil god that will suit the player and their character, based off both personality and player class. You can use the names and abilities of the Powers in the Amber Temple as a jumping off point, if you'd like, or just make one up. Either way, try to establish the following for each Dark Power:
    
    -   How do they eat souls?
        
        -   Pox, cold, fire, fall damage, whatever.
            
    -   What is the Dark Power's personality?
        
        -   Or, how will they interact with the player? Will they be godly, or seem just like an average joe? Will they appeal to the PC's sense of morality and secretly try to twist it, or offer straight up power or gold?
            
    -   Should my player go far with this Dark Power, what kind of boons will they receive?
        
        -   For making a deal with Delban, a PC might eventually get immunity to cold damage. Maybe they'll get a trait that temporarily boosts their AC for another Dark Power. You should figure out the theme of your boons.
            
        -   Remember, not all boons have to be useful. Some can be completely cosmetic. A PC might start having horrible nightmares or maybe their eyes turn solid white. Stuff that adds to the story and that other PCs will notice, but otherwise have no effect on gameplay/combat.
            

PC Interaction

Now that we've established what the Dark Powers actually want, how do we translate that into gameplay? How do we determine how and when a Dark Power will approach a PC to become their champion? We certainly can't just have an oogy-boogy devil come out of the shadows and say, "Join the Dark Side!" Almost every player in their right role-playing mind would refuse.

Instead, we have to make things much more subtle. The Dark Powers are tempting, not forceful. And as DMs role-playing these evil gods, we have to act accordingly. Bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!!!

-   **Stage 0: Contact**
    
    -   Asking for Help
        
        -   This is perhaps the most consistent and coolest way to establish contact with a Dark Power. With this method, the _players_ are the ones who initiate a connection with a Dark Power, which can make for an excellent and surprising bit of role-play.
            
        -   Wait for a PC to ask for help in character. Maybe they're dealing with a particularly frustrating NPC and they're like, "Lathander give me strength!" Or maybe they're in a heated battle with few hit points left and they say, "For the love of god, _miss_ you evil creature!"
            
        -   This is your way in. The players are asking for divine help, even accidentally. Calling out for some help is something that everybody does naturally in speech. We never expect that something might actually answer. This time, _it works_.
            
        -   Stop whatever is happening and have the player roll a Religion check. If their religion is particularly high or low, maybe a simple wisdom or charisma check instead.
            
        -   A DC 10 means something small will happen. Maybe the enemy will suddenly have disadvantage on their attack roll as a gust of wind blows their hair in their eyes. A DC 15 means something small and _consistant_ will happen. A sudden flash of light appears right in front of the enemy's eyes and blinds them, giving them disadvantage on _all_ their attacks for the next minute. A DC 20 means an outright miracle intervention. The ceiling suddenly caves in and crushes the enemy. The annoying NPC is suddenly unable to speak anything but the truth for a minute. Succeeding to this degree at Stage 0 means some cool shit.
            
    -   Answering a Need
        
        -   This is the second method of contact and is more of a later game connection.
            
        -   Remember that the Dark Powers are always actively looking for a champion. This potential champion is, ideally, someone whom they can easily control due to like-minded personalities as well as someone powerful. The more powerful the individual, the better champion they'll be.
            
        -   As the campaign progresses, the PCs are going to level up and get more and more powerful. That's a given. Somewhere at a midway point, the party is going to do something impressive. Maybe they'll defeat Wintersplinter at Yesterhill. Maybe they'll remove the curse from the Fidatov Manor or challenge the Abbot to a duel. Showing such strength is going to make the Dark Powers take notice.
            
        -   After a show of power, a Dark Power might visit a PC and offer help with a task. If the party is unsure where the Werewolf Den is, for instance, a Dark Power might show up to one PC in their dreams and offer directions. Remember, this is still a Stage 0 contact, however. There won't be any deal making or boons. Just a polite, "How d'ya do?" and a pinch of assistance.
            
    -   Shut Down
        
        -   It's completely possible that a PC's interactions with a Dark Power might never go beyond Stage 0. If they never seek further assistance or outright refuse any help offered by the dream being, the Dark Power isn't going to force a connection with them. Remember that it's okay for a PC or two to never have a Dark Power in this campaign.
            
-   **Stage 1: Connection**
    
    -   Once a player knows that something/someone is listening to them, they'll be hard pressed not to try and make contact again. As soon as you make them roll that Religion check the first time, it's a rare party that won't try and repeat the outcome. At this point, the PC will reach Stage 1, in which they begin forging a minimal understanding and relationship with the Dark Power.
        
    -   Mystery is Key
        
        -   Stage 1 is all about giving a little and then reeling them in, giving a little then reeling them in, giving a - you get the point. More fishing metaphors up in here.
            
        -   Basically, you don't want to info dump on a player. No, "I am Delban Master of Ice AND I CAN GIVE YOU ALL THE POWER!!!!"
            
        -   Keep it subtle. If the PC prays for guidance, the Dark Power can give them a sign. "Hey, mister god man who helped me before, Lady Watcher is giving me mixed signals. What's up with that?" _rolls 18 Religion._ DM - "You're suddenly struck with a vision of Lady Watcher in a heavy cloak, raising a ceremonial dagger."
            
    -   Once the connection grows and the PCs have used it a handful of times, the Dark Power will try to make an actual meeting.
        
        -   Dream visits are great for some minimal conversation, but the Dark Power will likely appear in a form that appeals to the player and talk more about the PC than themselves.
            
        -   They may also appear to a player when they're alone. Maybe a player is on watch duty and everyone else is asleep, for instance.
            
        -   This meeting is all about building a rapport with the player so that the players trust the Power.
            
-   **Stage 2: Pact**
    
    -   This is when you start giving out boons or traits. Once a player likes and trusts the Dark Power enough, they'll be willing to come to an agreement. The Dark Power will start giving them power ups and whatnot which could prove invaluable in battle.
        
        -   Resistance to an element. A trait that allows them to gain 5 temp hit points per long rest. Start small, and then work you're way up.
            
        -   Don't overload with traits. Treat these the same way you would treat magical weapons. You certainly don't want to give any party a bunch of magical weapons at once. Or a single particular game breaking magical weapon. Keep it small and simple.
            
        -   Also, just from general pacing, no single player should reach this stage until they're well into Vallaki at the very earliest. Level wise, level 5 or 6 might be a good marker to think about handing out a boon.
            
    -   During Stage 2, the Dark Power will _still_ not ask for anything in return (certainly not servitude or souls). _Maybe_ they'll ask for something minor, but most likely they'll justify their boons as help from a friend. If anything, they'll freely admit their hatred for Strahd. After all, they want to replace Strahd and Vampyr, so they're both enemies.
        
    -   Lastly, remember that even here at Stage 2, conversations should be limited. The Dark Powers can't just dump answers on the players. It's a fine line between too much and too little, but try to tread carefully.
        
-   **Stage 3: Dependence**
    
    -   At this point, a PC is basically addicted to their Dark Power. They try to contact the Dark Power frequently and use whatever boon(s) they might have on a regular basis. In a way, they're becoming reliant on the Dark Power and crave a closer connection in order to get more boons. Power is most certainly addictive, after all.
        
    -   This is when the Dark Power starts to show its true colors, as a player will likely continue the connection despite bad things happening.
        
    -   The following is likely to happen:
        
        -   The Dark Power will start to feed false information to the PC. "Hey should I trust Davian Martikov?" "_Definitely not._"
            
        -   The Dark Power will start to act against the rest of the party. The more alone the PC feels, the more dependent they'll be on the Power. Friends are therefore a no-no. "When you cast that spell, it's much stronger than you expect, practically incinerating the enemy! You hear its screeches as it takes the fire damage. However, you watch as the flames seem to grow a mind of their own and arch towards your friends as well! Jimmy, Laura, make Dex saves!"
            
    -   During Stage 3, PCs should see that either directly or indirectly, their relationships and general gameplay are taking a turn for the worst. People are dying and getting hurt. When they try to help NPCs, they often make the wrong decisions. While their powers are pretty baller, they tend to go to sleep in Barovia feeling bad about themselves.
        
-   **Stage 4: Ownership**
    
    -   This is the most critical stage of connecting to a Dark Power. By the time any PC reaches Stage 4, they should be of a higher level and likely somewhere in the last fourth of the campaign.
        
    -   Stage 4 PCs usually have the following:
        
        -   At least a few different boons from the Dark Power. At this point, they should be a little over-powered if we're being completely honest.
            
        -   The attacks against the other party members should be less accidental and more outright hostile. There are bad things happening at the worst moments, to the point where it can't be a coincidence anymore.
            
        -   The afflicted PC has blackouts, loosing temporary control over their character. Say they want to cast an attack spell on an enemy, but you as a DM know they have an AOE spell in their list, meaning it'll hit the other party members in vicinity as well. "You hold up your hand and begin the quick, familiar incantation for Magic Missile. Suddenly, you feel a jolt come from within you, crackling through your bones. You can't control your own voice as you say the incantation for Fireball instead and the flames leap forth!"
            
        -   In role-play, the player may go to sleep at night and wake up in another building, next to someone killed in a way indicative of the Dark Power. Or it's some other dark scene. You get it.
            
        -   Pile on the cosmetic changes!!!! Anything dark and evident of the Dark Power should show itself.
            
        -   As an example, one player in my campaign has reached Stage 4 with Delban (the ice guy). She's a warlock teifling. Her hellish rebuke gives off cold damage instead of fire. She's immune to cold damage, but vulnerable to fire damage. Her skin is not only freezing to the touch, but she's basically a walking air conditioner. Any room she spends time in gets frigidly cold in no time. Though winter has been approaching in Barovia, it's looking like this year will be really rough and all the NPCs make comments about it. Basically, cold, cold, cold, and more cold. I've piled it on thick.
            
    -   Immortality
        
        -   At Stage 4, a PC has almost completely lost their soul to the Dark Power. Their soul is still recoverable, but it's not totally their own anymore. Because of this, the PC becomes basically immortal. If they die, the Dark Power brings them back to life again. Unless it's something crazy like complete disintegration, the PC doesn't stay dead.
            
        -   Yet again, I'll remind you that this is late campaign stage. No PC should reach this stage until high levels. And even then, they won't know about their immortality unless they test it, which is unlikely to happen.
            
    -   A Threat to Vampyr
        
        -   If any PC reaches Stage 4 with a Dark Power and meets Strahd face-to-face, Vampyr will _know_. Though Vampyr and Strahd aren't close, Strahd still understands where his power comes from. He won't tolerate a threat to his throne. And Vampyr certainly won't tolerate a threat to his demiplane.
            
        -   If you're familiar with [u/guildsbounty](https://www.reddit.com/u/guildsbounty/)'s [lovely post on running Strahd like the scariest mo-fo that ever did vampire](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8ts5bg/my_notes_on_running_strahd_like_an_unholy_terror/), this constitutes Strahd going into Destroy-the-PCs mode.
            
-   **Stage 5: Champion**
    
    -   At Stage 5, Strahd is defeated and Vampyr is displaced as ruler of Barovia. The player looses complete control of their character as they become locked into their pact with the Dark Power. Game over, cue the bad ending.
        

Beast Mode

-   Beast Mode is an effect which I created for a temporary divine intervention of the Dark Powers. Throughout the campaign, I’ve placed certain story markers and triggers that will summon a Dark Power to a character. These instances will usually occur at a place of great turmoil and desperation, where the player is more likely to want the help a god can give them, evil or not. Upon acceptance, the player will effectively enter a temporary Beast Mode version of themselves, complete with super powers reflective of their Dark Power patron.
    
    -   This can also be an excellent alternative to PC death. If a PC totally and completely dies, especially early in the campaign, a Dark Power can reach out to them and then and offer them a connection. The player goes into Beast Mode temporarily before loosing the power.
        
-   What is Beast Mode?
    
    -   I secretly made a copy of each of my player’s character sheets and then leveled them up to level 19. Their stats went through the roof and they had more traits than even I knew what to do with. But on top of all that, I gave them extra abilities that suited their Dark Power.
        
    -   Upon a certain trigger, like death, you give the player this temporary, beefed up character sheet to use in combat.
        
        -   I would recommend you plan for Beast Mode uses, though. Set up some “if, then” scenarios. ‘If my players do this at this location, then the druid will hit Beast Mode’, for example.
            
        -   Also, use these sparingly. You don’t want to overindulge your players after all. You want them to feel like Beast Mode is a wonderful, one-time reward. Each player should only use a Beast Mode once in the campaign, if at all.
            

# On Strahd

For what it's worth, this is the process I imagined happened to Strahd when he first came to the valley of Barovia. He would have met Vampyr completely accidentally during one of his initial visits to the Amber Temple. As proud as he was, even then, Strahd would have never seen Vampyr's subtle connection as a threat.

Vampyr would have fostered a connection with Strahd, feeding him the power to destroy his enemies and settle the valley in the name of his parents. And that power would have been hopelessly addictive, especially since it allowed Strahd to save the lives of his men by doing more of the fighting himself.

When Tatyana came along, Vampyr was the one whispering in Strahd's ear, telling Strahd he was too old for her. Vampyr fed Strahd's insecurities, making Strahd more volatile and pushing Tatyana even farther away. I imagine that it might even have been Vampyr himself who somehow guided [[Sergei von Zarovich|Sergei]] to Barovia, knowing it would make Strahd desperate for more power.

And it worked. Strahd finally gave himself completely to Vampyr in order to forsake his own death and earn Tatyana's love. However, Vampyr consistantly keeps Tatyana away from Strahd so that Strahd will keep needing him. Thus creates the endless cycle of misery and power that truly makes up Strahd's curse.

Breaking a Connection with a Dark Power

In most cases, your players will realize that something is up with the gods whispering to them, especially if they reach Stage 3. They'll want to disconnect from the Dark Power.

-   Stages 1-3
    
    -   It's actually surprisingly easy to break a connection to a Dark Power in any of these stages. Quite simply, a PC just has to tell the Dark Power, "No." No, I don't want help. No, I don't want to talk, get the hell out of my dreams. No, I won't use your boon, take it back. Basically, this is Barovia's Just Say No to Drugs speech.
        
    -   The Dark Power will be appropriately angry, but because they don't have an active champion or equivalent pawn to work through, they can't actually do much about it. Up until this point, the PC has been the pawn.
        
    -   The Dark Power will do everything they can to change the PC's mind. Persuasion, begging, offering more power, temptations, etc. But in the end, a persistent PC can put their foot down and banish the Dark Power. The Dark Power will take their boons (if they gave any at that point) and never return.
        
-   Stage 4
    
    -   Breaking the connection at Stage 4 is just as simple. Just say no. The only difference is that there's usually some kind of backlash as the PC regains the other half of their lost soul.
        
    -   You should give the PC a temporary anti-boon or stat debuff that lasts a few in-game days. The PC should get sick or their magic is on the fritz or their Constitution is a 5 for three days. They should be able to feel this break and it shouldn't be pretty.
        
    -   For added effect, don't let players know the debuffs are temporary. Just let them waltz through feeling horrible and then regain themselves in time.

    -   Stage 5ers can't break their connection. They've given their soul to the Dark Power and are effectively lost. If the connection _were_ broken - likely forcefully as in the case with Strahd - the breakage would kill them permanently.

That's it folks! Those are my notes on running Dark Powers in game. While this is quite detailed, don't fret about it too much. It's unlikely that most players will go very far with a Dark Power, especially once they sense something is up. I'm currently in the last stretch of my game and I've got one Stage 4 player, one Stage 2 player, and one that didn't go past Stage 0. So, while this looks long and complicated, it's more there for the sake of being prepared.

Both everywhere and nowhere, the Dark Powers are not quite a proper faction—their goals are inscrutable, their true agenda concealed. As the nameless jailers of Strahd von Zarovich, they seek only to ensure that his prison remains in place, and his suffering continues. 

As part of Strahd’s punishment, however, the Dark Powers quietly work to keep the soul of Tatyana Federovna—now reincarnated as Ireena Kolyana—out of the vampire’s reach. 

For all their might, it is against the nature of the Dark Powers to act directly upon the souls within their domains: they can neither destroy her, nor command her spirit. However, as they once did with Strahd, the Dark Powers can always offer a choice—in Ireena’s case, a choice to end her existence, to flee from Strahd’s pursuit, and to find the safety of temporary oblivion. Nearly five hundred years ago, Tatyana Federovna accepted this offer, and leapt from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to her doom. Two centuries later, Marina Ulrich did the same, and let slip to her father the secret of Strahd’s pursuit. 

Time and time again, the women bearing Tatyana’s soul have been offered this choice and, bereft of other options, made the decision to accept it. It is not yet Ireena’s time—but the Dark Powers are patient, and they know that, alone, she will inevitably fall once more into their grasp.
