Werewolf Pack 

The werewolf pack—the members of whom call themselves the Children of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mother Night]]—are largely as described in Chapter 15: Werewolf Den (p. 201). Until Strahd’s awakening, the pack largely used Barovia as a place to rest between hunts, occasionally prowling the roads between settlements, but preferring the tastier meat of the lands beyond the mists. 

However, when Strahd awoke, he demanded the loyalty of the werewolves whose forebears had once served him faithfully. He threatened to seal the pack within the mists for all eternity if they defied him—but promised them wealth, power, and plentiful prey if they returned to his service. 

Emil, the leader of the pack, resisted Strahd’s efforts to strip the pack of its agency. He quietly argued that the Children of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mother Night]] had always been free—free to hunt and kill and live as they chose—and suggested that the pack pretend to accept Strahd’s terms, but abandon Barovia as soon as the mists reopened to them. 

But Emil was betrayed. Kiril, a young and haughty werewolf who felt his strength had gone unrecognized, was lured by Strahd’s promises of riches and might. Kiril reported Emil’s 
plot to Strahd’s own ear—and, when the vampire’s dire wolves dragged Emil to the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, was rewarded with the leadership of the werewolf pack. 

Now, as the pack’s new alpha and Strahd’s faithful servant, Kiril leads his werewolves on a savage and bloody crusade to dominate the wild places of Barovia, though he dreams of 
one day surmounting the settlements’ walls and devouring their people like sheep. Meanwhile, Emil’s mate Zuleika, the pack’s holy woman and soothsayer, sits alone in Mother Night’s shrine, silently praying for deliverance—or vengeance.
