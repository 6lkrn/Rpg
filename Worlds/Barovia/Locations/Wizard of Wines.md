# **WINTERSPLINTER ATTACKS**

If the characters leave the winery and return at a later time before dealing with Wintersplinter (see the "Druids' Ritual" section in chapter 14), the enormous tree blight (see appendix D) is sent from [[Yester Hill]] to ravage the vineyard and destroy the winery.

**The Wizard of Wines Winery** is [Barovia's](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Barovia "Barovia") only winery, the home of the Martikov family, and the center of operations for the [Keepers of the Feather](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Keepers_of_the_Feather "Keepers of the Feather").

Historically, three powerful artifacts have allowed wine grapes to grow at the winery, despite Barovia's cold, sunless climate. One of these artifacts went missing many years ago. A second was stolen about fifteen years prior to the events of the campaign, and was later recovered from [Baba Lysaga's](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Baba_Lysaga "Baba Lysaga") creeping hut. The third was stolen by the druids of [Yester Hill](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Yester_Hill "Yester Hill") and placed within the heart of Wintersplinter in order to animate the tree. The second and third gems were used to create a magical arm of vines and leaves for [Liluth after](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Liluth_Chaemaer "Liluth Chaemaer") she sacrificed her arm to [the Abbot](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/The_Abbot "The Abbot").

After their encounter with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] near [Krezk Pool](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Krezk_Pool "Krezk Pool"), Liluth, [Fate](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Fate "Fate"), [Stellaluna](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Stellaluna_Silverleaf "Stellaluna Silverleaf"), and [Solaris](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Solaris_Silverleaf "Solaris Silverleaf") fled from [Vanargand](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Vanargand "Vanargand") and his pack of werewolves, seeking refuge at the winery. [[[Fyodor Martikov]]](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Fyodor_Martikov "[[Fyodor Martikov]]") brought them to his mother, [Elsa](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Elsa_Martikov "Elsa Martikov"), who helped them escape through a network of secret tunnels. The kenku child, [Daisy](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy "Daisy"), was left behind at the winery for safekeeping.

Upon discovering that the party had lied to him about the location of [Ezmerelda d'Avenir](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Ezmerelda_d%27Avenir "Ezmerelda d'Avenir") and had then taken refuge in the winery, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] ordered the werewolves to burn the winery to the ground. Fyodor later revealed that the Martikovs have secret havens in the area around the winery, but he was unsure how many, if any, of his family had survived the fire.
