The creature that erupts from the wooden statue is a tree blight (see appendix D) that the druids call Wintersplinter. The green light comes from the magic gem embedded in its "heart." The gem can be removed only when Wintersplinter is dead.

**Yester Hill** is an ancient druidic site in western [Barovia](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Barovia "Barovia"). Once a mass grave heaped with earth, this cairn has become a hill on which an ancient, twisted tree grows. Barovia's mountain clans have long used the hill as a site for druidic blood rituals.

When [Lilluth](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Liluth_Chaemaer "Liluth Chaemaer"), [Fate](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Fate "Fate"), [Stellaluna](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Stellaluna_Silverleaf "Stellaluna Silverleaf"), and [Solaris dined](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Solaris_Silverleaf "Solaris Silverleaf") at [Castle Ravenloft](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Ravenloft "Castle Ravenloft"), [[Strahd von Zarovich]] asked the party to stop the druids of Yester Hill from carrying out a ritual in [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s name, with which [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] said that he did not wish to be associated.

Later, the party heard from [[[Fyodor Martikov]]](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Fyodor_Martikov "Fyodor Martikov") that the Yester Hill druids had stolen one of the artifacts that the Marikovs used to grow the grapes at [their winery](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_of_Wines_Winery "Wizard of Wines Winery"). After [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] burned the winery, the party continued on to Yester Hill and encountered a blood ritual, with druids executing prisoners and spilling their blood on a stone altar at the base of a great, dark tree. The party was unable to stop the ritual, and Wintersplinter was awakened. Defeating the tree blight, the party recovered one of the lost artifacts, a large gem which Lilluth used to grow herself a new arm of vines and leaves.[[]]
