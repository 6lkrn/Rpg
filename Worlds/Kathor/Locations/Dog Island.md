## Dog Island (Island of Bitches)

Description

The Island is shaped like a paw - One main Island, and four smaller islands to the North.

### Main Island –

-  A utopia on the surface. Lots of greenery, all year round spring weather, lots of parks, paths for walks.
    
-  The Council is located at the centre of the island. This is surrounded by larger kennels (mansions). The upper-class of the Island is separated by Ring Road. Outside of Ring Road there are schools, hospitals, shops, police stations. Around this there are medium sized kennels, followed by smaller kennels on the outskirts of the island.  
    
- Three underground/underwater tunnels run from inside the Council’s premises (Main Island) to Mini Island 1, 2 and 3. The tunnels are used to transport people to and from the islands discreetly. Mini Island 4 is only accessible by sea.
    
-  Population of 1500.
    

Mini Island 1 – Dog shelter for the poor, abandoned, neglected strays.

Mini Island 2 – Geriatric care facilities, nursing homes, retirement village. No old dogs are allowed on the mainland (55+) because they ruin the vibes.

Mini Island 3 – Immigration Detention Centre. Houses asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants, citizens who have recently had their citizenship revoked, badly behaved tourists. Could be transported back to the mainland or deported after assessment.  

Mini Island 4 – Private property. Mysterious, unknown buyer.
