Lives on [[Dog Island]]

Girlfriend of [[Pochi]].

After [[Pochi]] died, she seized control of around 1/3 of hid old gang. 

She promised to support the crew as long as they got her a house on the main island. The crew promised her [[Alpha]]'s mansion.

The crew brought her along with them on a ship of her own. They planned to assault the main island and the navy stationed there.

June and [[Intellectus]] sailed east around the island while the crew sailed west. They were intercepted by [[Dard]] and [[Deagle]].

The crew sold her out and the rebellion on [[Dog Island]] was blamed on her instead of [[Scruffy]] and [[Intellectus]].
