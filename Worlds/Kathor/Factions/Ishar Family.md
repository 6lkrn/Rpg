The Ishar are from an ancient subbranch of the Imperial Family. Though they have fallen by the wayside and no longer enjoy the favour or privilege of the Imperial Family, they still use their distant blood relation to gain what small bit of influence they can.

They own the largest crystal mine in [[New Kunaan]], though much gossip has spread about troubles with loan sharks and gambling in the family's history.
