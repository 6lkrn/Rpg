The pub is the only two-story building in town, and is identified by a wooden sign showing a set of standing stones similar to those at Stonehenge. Downstairs is a dilapidated
barroom with a wooden bar at one end and a stone fireplace at the other. Behind the bar are tuns of ale and, concealed under the bar, three earthenware. 
flasks of a fiery distilled liquor. 

In the carne of the bur is a ladder to a trapdoor in the ceiling which leads to [[MacHeath]] and [[Lara]]'s room. [[MacHeath]] carries most of the bar's cash with him (20-200 gp).
