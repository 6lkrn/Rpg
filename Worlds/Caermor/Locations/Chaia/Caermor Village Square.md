In the middle is a weathered stone standing about 5 high, with a rusted pump emerging from it.

The pump is low (3 ft. off the ground and sill works, although the water is rusty.)

Close inspection of the stone shows almost obliterated runes in an ancient form of the common tongue (intelligence OF 16+ required to read it. The only legible section of the scribbling reads:

â€œ.... and did [[Aelfred Foehammer]] hers, by the grace of [[Turanis Firehand]], slay the dwarven chieftain, in the year 3014 on..."

Standing stones. Like the stones on the pub's sign, these are like a small version of Stonehenge. They are aged and weathered, and the cross-pieces across the tops of the stones have been cast down. Half-eroded dwarven runes remain on some of the stones; anyone who speaks dwarvish can recognize their nature, but they are weathered to illegibility.

Many generations ago, a human general named [[Aelfred Foehammer]] descended upon the area with a mighty army of humans and elves, intending to wipe out the evil dwarves that dwelt in the area. The final battle took place upon this hill since named [[Caermor]] (meaning "Hill of Death") among these stones. The dwarven leader, [[Balorn]], saw his force disintegrating and knew his own end was near. His final act was a prayer to the dwarven god of revenge, [[Cador]], for the power to take undying vengeance. His prayer was granted. As the final blow fell, [[Balorn]] was no longer there to receive it. He had become a shade, with vengeance against humans and elves his only goal. 

[[Balorn]] is only encountered between sunset and sunrise, and only within the compass of the standing stones. There, he use the most effective means available to wreak his vengeance on any human or elf that enters his ken. As befits any dwarf who swears fealty to the evil [[Cador]] (whether the dwarf is alive or undead), [[Balorn]] is clean shaven, an abomination in the eyes of any other dwarf.
