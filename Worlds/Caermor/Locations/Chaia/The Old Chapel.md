The Old Chapel

The map above shows the old chapel inhabited by the [[Tiamat]] cult. The ceiling height is 9' unless otherwise stated.

1. [[Priest]]'s chamber. A decayed cot and table have been left behind. The room is occupied by two giant rats.

2. Robing room. Hooks around the walls identify this as a robing room. A ladder leads up to a closed trap door in the ceiling. Close observation shows that the dust on the floor has been recently disturbed.

3. Chapel. The room has no windows, but empty torch brackets on the walls indicate how it was lit. The altar at the south end of the room appears to be a solid block of rough-hewn stone with no markings or inscriptions. Observation of the floor shows that the dust has been recently disturbed, particularly around the altar. Examination of the altar itself shows fresh scratches (possibly from claws) at the southwest and southeast bottom corners of the altar.

The altar is actually hollow and opens from south to north, like a very thick trap door. The chance of opening it each round equals a character's open doors roll. Below the altar is a steep stairway leading down into darkness.

4. Storage. Behind a secret door is a storage room for altar fittings. Only a few remain: a green silk altar cloth (worth 50 gp), two gold candlesticks (125 gp each), and a gold goblet studded with opals (300 gp).

5. Bell tower. The ceiling here is 15' high. The trapdoor from the robing room opens directly into the bell tower. The single bell remains, though very corroded. The clapper is missing, how- ever. The tower has four arched openings, 4' off the floor, 8' high, and 10' wide, one centered in each wall. By day, the tower is always vacant. At night, there is a 25% chance that the devil is present. If it hears any noise from down below, it certainly investigates and fights to the death.

6. Stairs. These descend 30' below the altar.
