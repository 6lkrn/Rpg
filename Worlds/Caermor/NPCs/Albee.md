Albee is the outsider blamed by most villagers for the tribulations visited upon [[Caermor]], He is an artist from [Sta Far](Sta%20Far.md), formerly a magic-user-in training, and came to [[Caermor]] two months ago to sketch, paint, and experience the wind-swept heaths. Viewed as a ne'er do-well by the townsfolk, he decided to avoid them, so he rented an old shack outside the village. He met [[Gwendolyn]] on a trip to the pub one day, and it was love at first sight for both. At first, their meetings were circumspect, but they became more open as the  relationship deepened.

Albee is innocent of any slayings, as the atrocities escalated, he belatedly realized that the town was starting to look on him as the possible culprit, but he did not want to leave because of [[Gwendolyn]]. One fateful night, [[Gwendolyn]] came over to Albee's house unexpectedly; unwilling to let her leave with the monster about, Albee had her stay almost until dawn, Almost as soon as [Gwendolyn](Gwendolyn.md) had left, [[Mother Gloam]] pounded on his door and warned him that a posse was coming to get him for his dallying with the girl. Without 
questioning her, he fled.

Albee now hides in a small cave under the very hill that gives the village its name, living on roots and berries and an occasional rabbit. Affected by his solitary lifestyle and the strange noises at night, Albee's sanity has slipped: he is now quite paranoid and has a tendency to talk to his pictures of [[Gwendolyn]]. If Albee is encountered outside his cave, he is seen in the distance as a wild looking man with ragged clothes and unruly hair staring at the characters. Because of his familiarity with the terrain and his obsessive fear of others, his chance of evasion if pursued is increased by 25%.
