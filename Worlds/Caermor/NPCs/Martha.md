[[Martha]], close friend (and no more) to [Tremayne and Verlayne](Tremayne%20and%20Verlayne.md) and henchman of [[Lane]], appears to be a fragile maiden. In fact, she is considerably more fierce and mare skilled than either brother.

While the twins feel they have to protect her, it often falls to [[Martha]] to protect them. She is intelligent enough to recognize the advantage in not having this known; however, she tends to fake & whatever-will-become-of-me? helplessness, and her Armor and weapons are always concealed. Her loyalty to [[Lane]] is strong (he saved her life, after all), but it is not as unquestioning as that of the brothers.
