[[MacHeath]]'s wife, Lara, works as a assistant bartender and waitress at the pub. Worn down by long hours and subjugated by her husband, she is quiet and meek and seems considerably older than her 30 years.

Even though [[MacHeath]] makes the mistake of assuming she is stupid, Lara is not and knows more about the true state of affairs in the village than most.

She is well aware that the city-boy [[Albee]] is not guilty of the recent atrocities, and is convinced that the guilty parties are actually closer to home, although she does not know exactly who they are. She is sure, however, that her husband is among them — when drunk, he often tells her of how grand their life will be “after its all done” — and the certainty brings her great pain. She suspects nothing of [[Belle]], but only because the child has charmed her.

Lara knows that she must do something, but knows that trying to take steps on her own only brings a beating from her husband. She sees in the adventurers an opportunity to do some thing positive. At any time she meets the characters, she sizes them up. If they seem trustworthy, she confides in them what she knows and suspects. (everything except her husband's involvement), but only if [[MacHeath]] cannot observe her doing so. If [[MacHeath]] is around, she attempts to arrange a clan destine meeting with the characters, but in no way will she risk herself.
