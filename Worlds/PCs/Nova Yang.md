A man walks into a nondescript room. Set against a vast expanse of darkness, there is only a grey couch. He raises an eyebrow, but he doesn’t look all that surprised. Amusement is the main expression there. Right. Another one of those dreams, then. He takes a seat and waits.

This place… it is mysterious and unpredictable. Each time he appears, something different would happen: a panel of people would appear before him; a familiar face made unfamiliar, a brother or a lover by a different world; and rarely, very rarely, he would be left staring into a broken mirror, seeing himself reflected yet too strange to recognise.

One thing remains certain. They all appear for the same reason:

They are here to talk.

This time is no exception. Soon enough, a voice–a voice neither masculine nor feminine yet both at the same time, warbled to hell and back yet crystal clear–sounds out. It echoes in this dark void.

Family: We all have a family, be it by blood or by social bond. Our heritage can impact the way we see the world and ourselves. What is your family like, how did the way you were raised affect who you became?

“Hey, watch it, bud: I could be an orphan for all you know,” though his words cut, he wears a grin on his face. “My family’s relatively small. There’s me, my twin, our two older brothers, and our dad.” He pauses. “Half-brothers, really. I… huh.” He frowns. “I don’t actually know how they came about, to be honest. I never thought to ask my dad if he was ever married or whatever, and he never bothered to talk about it. Maybe I should bring that up next time we meet……” he trails off with pursed lips. A heartbeat later, he continues speaking, “Whatever. I don’t know who their mom is, but I know mine: Marquise Spinnerette [[MindFang]].” He stops for a beat. “Yes, the Marquise. Of the Novafire’s Cerulean Scorpion fleet. No, I don’t know how he knocked her up, and I kind of don’t wanna know. I mean, how would you like it if your dad told you how he fucked your mom real good on their honeymoon to make you, huh?” He pauses. “Not that I think my dad fucked my mom on any kind of honeymoon. They don’t act that chummy, which makes you wonder even more how they got it on.”

“Uh, anyways, yeah, you can guess that since she’s literally a pirate captain, she doesn’t have the time to take care of two little brats, so she obviously dumped us with Dad. It’s not a bad life, really–frankly, I’m pretty sure toddler life on a pirate ship would be worse,” he sticks his tongue out at no one in particular. “爸 dabbles in technomancy, but mostly, like, as a magic repairman. Maybe he does some small scale crafting here and there, but I’m not too privy to that shit: I’m, uh, not smart enough for that kind of stuff.” He rubs the back of his head. “I just help fetch whatever materials he needs. If you wanna know more, you can ask Sollux—that’s one of my elder brothers. Or you can just ask 爸. No guarantees he’ll answer, though.”

“But, uh, yeah, growing up was…… mundane, really. I got older, I went to school, I got kicked out of school, I helped my dad around the house, and now I’m here. I didn’t even really see my mom until recently, to be honest: she’s been cajoling my sister to come with her. 阿星’s not keen on it, since she’s had the privilege to actually go get higher education, but 妈 keeps trying to refute that by saying she can take her somewhere more prestigious.” He frowns. “I don’t really know why she’s so insistent on that, to be honest. Xing’s never been that adventurous. Not a complete loser hikikomori, but my sister definitely wouldn’t like life on the ships.”

He devolves into silence for a moment. “Uh, wow, I feel like I went on a tangent there. What else did you ask? ‘How did the way you were raised affect who you became?’” He purses his lips as he thinks about this. He shrugs. “I dunno. I think I came out a relatively average guy. Definitely got in an above-average amount of fights, but… I mean, I didn’t kill anyone or whatever. Average teenager behaviour, y’know? I don’t mind that we’re not well-off or well-known or whatever. So long as I have my family, no matter how much of a dipshit we may be to each other, I’m happy. And I’m sure they feel the same.” He laughs. It quickly abates as it falls into silence once more. He speaks this next part quieter than the rest.

“...But I have to say, I… got restless. Nothing ever changes there. You wake up, you do the same things you did yesterday, you go to sleep, rinse and repeat. I mean, an idyllic life is great–I don’t have to worry about anything, my family doesn’t have to worry about me–but despite that… I still yearn for adventure. You ever heard of that saying—live fast, die young? That’s what I want. I want blood, I want guts, I want chocolate cake.” A grin settles across his face, a faraway look present in his mismatched eyes. He sighs. “Mituna had the same idea, y’know? Sol stayed to help Dad with the business–hell, last I heard, he might be ready to hand it over to him entirely–but Mituna wasn’t satisfied with all that. He packed whatever he could and just… left. Said something about ‘conquering the skies’ and ‘showing birds what’s what’, then he… never looked back.” He turns away, still looking at a point that’s not entirely here. “Of course, he still wrote home, but it’s been a while since I’ve been home. I’m not sure how well he’s doing nowadays.”

“So, to recap, I have a dad, two older brothers, and a twin sister. My mom’s a pirate, she doesn’t come home except to pester my sister, and my dad doesn’t even like her mug. I lived a fairly uneventful life, as average as possible, but I wanted more, so I left.” He leans back, arms behind his head.

“About as cliché as origins go, huh?”

Home: We all come from somewhere. Home is where the heart is, a place that you feel connected to no matter where you may be. Where do you consider to be home? Is it where you grew up, a place you made for yourself, or somewhere from your favourite memories?

I’m too lazy to write a monologue where he talks about his hometown. Very basically, it’s the Kathoran equivalent of Guangzhou, Guangdong, China: a quaint seaside province. Nova and his family live a bit further inland, about half an hour to an hour away from the waters. Alongside Common/Kathoran/English/whatever-we’re-calling-it, he can also speak the Kathoran equivalent of Chinese (which means yes, you will hear me talk in Chinese again, fuck you) and Cantonese (which I unfortunately am not fluent in, so you’re lucky).

Even as a young child, Nova was always getting into trouble, starting fights left and right. His dad at some point got so fed up with it, he decided that if his son were to keep getting into fistfights, he should at least win them.

He also developed a fear of the ocean–and big bodies of water, in general–after he nearly drowned once. A kind stranger saved him—a kind stranger that he not only befriended, but went on to marry later in his adulthood.

Education and training: Where did you get your skills and abilities?  Did you have a specific teacher or mentor? Did you apprentice or were you self taught?

“You’d think 妈 taught me, considering she’s, well, a fucking pirate captain, but you’d be wrong. I mean, actually, I did, uh… intern on her ship for a bit, I guess. I mean, she wasn’t gonna let her son–bastard as he is–go out there and embarrass her in front of her colleagues, so she made sure I at least knew what living on a ship is like, what’s expected of me, and also that I could not get a panic attack every time I, like, look over the railing.” He pauses. “Not to say I’m going anywhere in the ocean. I’m not. I’d fucking fight you on this.”

“Oh, but crucially, 妈 didn’t teach me how to fight. I mean, she was never home, especially when I was younger. So, amusingly, my dad was the one who taught me.” He pauses to let the fact sink in. “Yeah. I didn’t– I didn’t think he had it in him, y’know? I mean, he’s some hikikomori geek who’d much rather spend his entire life locked in a basement with machines than spend one second with a crowd. So when he said to me, ‘Nova, listen, if you’re gonna get into scuffles this constantly, at least win them,’ I snapped back, ‘Oh yeah? Why don’t you fucking show me how it’s done, then, old man?’”

“And he fuckin’ did. He showed how it’s fucking done. Lemme tell ya, I have never had my ass handed to me that professionally and methodically since that fucking day. Not gonna lie, I was mad pissed when it happened–I was, and kinda still am, a sore loser–but, like, then he showed me how to serve ass that good as well, so I can’t complain.”

He scratches his head. “I don’t know how he got that good. I’ve… tried to ask, a lot of times, but he either doesn’t give a straight answer or outright refuses to answer. I’ve asked around as well, but… everyone has a different answer and none of them correlate with each other.” He holds three fingers out, putting one down each time he goes over a family member. “Mituna thinks he was part of some super secret service; Sollux thinks he was part of the rebellion that tried to overthrow the Empress—the Middle Kingdom Empress, you know, before the Imperial Court took over everything; 妈 says he used to work as her helmsman. No one agrees with each other, and my dad won’t fucking tell me, so—” he sighs. “Just don’t ask me how he got skills like that. He just does.”

“Frankly, I think Xing’s explanation is most logical: he really just learnt it when he was younger. Around these parts of town, back then, martial arts was a really big thing. I mean, there’s not much else to do, right? And if you wanna be a 帅哥 without breaking the law, that’s what you do. And hey, who knows? Maybe you’re gonna get so good when the Imperial army recruiters come around, you get to join and bring great honour to the family, or whatever it is old people were concerned about. Makes sense, dunnit?”

Still, he rubs the back of his head.

“I swear, though… the way he fights….” he purses his lips. “I swear, you only learn how to move like that by being in a bunch of scuffles. Trust me on this: I’m a professional at getting into fights.”

Why didn’t you listen to mom and become a banker? The life of adventure is not for everyone. For one reason or another, you haven’t chosen to settle down and work an ordinary job. Why did you end up on this path? Is there a non-adventuring job you considered, or one which you would like to take up some day?

He laughs. “If 妈 told me to become a banker, I’d call her an impostor and spray silver on her. Me becoming a pirate is probably what she’d want. I mean, I think she’d like it better if it was Xing instead of me, but hey, beggars can’t be choosers. ‘Sides, I make the perfect pirate, don’t I? Hot-blooded, hot, strong,” here, he flexes a bit; he is indeed quite well-toned, “and most importantly, I’ve got that fire burning in me, y’know? That desire to go out, to explore, to become someone so awe-inspiring that, generations down the line, people end up in the position I’m in now because of me.”

He leans back, arms akimbo behind his head as he kicks his legs up onto the table.

“I don’t think there’s any other life that would suit me as well as this one, huh?”

(The silence drags on. “Well, if I had to be anything else, I’d be a baker, maybe,” he mumbles. “My family says I make great pastries.”)

What is best in life? What kind of lifestyle are you used to? We all have our preferred creature comforts. Some people are happy as long as they have a comfy chair and a warm fire, others demand the finer things in life. And some people seem happy with stale bread and a rock to sleep on. What do you need in order to be comfortable, and how much more do you aspire to?

“Eh. As I’ve said, my life back home was… nothing to write home about…” he trails off and frowns at the awkward turn of phrase. “Well, the point is it was as mundane as it could get. Secure and safe, with nothing ever changing. Not that that’s a bad thing, but… well, ultimately, it could bore a guy.”

“What do I need in order to be comfortable, you ask? Bitches, bread, a bed. Need I say more?” He grins. “I don’t really care that much about riches or whatever. So long as I get to live my life the way I want to–eat what I want, sleep when I want, fuck whoever I want–I’m happy.”

What principles do you believe in? What causes do you support? Not everything we care about is a personal goal or quest. We all have positions on certain issues and sympathies that lie with groups and causes. Maybe you won’t join up and fight their battles, but you’ll at least sign their petition whenever they ask.

“Eh…” he leans back. “Uh… I guess… well, I’m gonna be honest, I feel like my ‘principles’ are just excuses to pick a fight,” he chuckles, “ but… I don’t like dipshits picking on people smaller than them, figuratively and literally. Find someone your own size, y’know? Why punch down? Only reason is you know you’re a spaghetti-limbed cunt who can only look strong.”

Why did that guy deserve a punch in the face? People do all kinds of things that get under our skin. What do people do that drives you nuts? What bugs you more than anything else?

“I’m gonna be honest witcha, chief, listing things that won’t piss me off would be easier than the alternative. You know why?” He leans forward with a wide grin. “Because it’s empty. Hot-headed, short-fused, temperamental—whatever other words exist for ‘dipshit who gets angry at the slightest thing’, that’s been used to describe me. The only way to truly never piss me off is to probably never interact with me in the first place,” he laughs.

“Oh, but I gotta say, I hate ‘all bark, no bite’ kind of fuckers. The kind that talks shit, but as soon as they get hit, they run back to mommy.” He scoffs. “Listen, even I at one point in my life couldn’t dish out what I promised, but you wouldn’t see me shit my pants and cry about it. You talked the talk, now you walk it, bitch.”

Religion: Divine powers are an accepted, observable part of life in life. There are many gods to choose from, each with their own teachings and beliefs. Faith can give us hope and strength in dark times, and guidance through uncertainty. It can change the way we relate to the world, to each other, and even to ourselves. What religion, if any, do you follow? What is your opinion of the other gods? What do you think of religious people and institutions?

“Meh.” He shrugs. “I couldn’t care less about Gods. My family couldn’t care less about Gods—where I come from, the… norm, I guess, is… ancestral worship? Is that what you ang mo call it? We have a small room in the house dedicated to those who came before us, and we light incense and offer food or whatever to it every so often.”

He shrugs again. “I couldn’t care less about that either, but… eh…” he rubs the back of his head, looking somewhat embarrassed. “Uh… you know how it is. Old habits die hard, and whatnot.”

Morals: We all have our limits. Only the most insane of sociopaths won’t draw the moral line somewhere. What is your moral code? What line won’t you cross?

“Uh…… kids, the elderly, the disabled……?” He shrugs. “I don’t really care. I mean, I won’t go out of my way to, like… beat a homeless guy or a 10-year-old up specifically, but I couldn’t care less if they get caught in the crossfire.” A beat passes. “Well, maybe I care a little if a 10-year-old got caught up in the crossfire,” he mumbles, the embarrassment from earlier crawling into his voice. “B-But I won’t… really know a 10-year-old got caught up in my shit, so, like,” he shrugs, “what do I care, right?”

He pauses. “I guess I won’t kill my family even if everything else was on the line. Over my dead body first.”

He pauses again. “Or my wife. I’d kill this entire ship myself before I let anything happen to my wife.”

A long moment of silence. “Is that the answer you wanted to hear?” He scratches the back of his head. “I dunno what you want from me, man; I’m a pirate, not a philosopher.”

What do you do outside of adventuring? What are your hobbies, interests, or favourite pastimes? What do you do when you have nothing else that needs doing?

“Uh.” He turns a soft shade of red. “Well… I mean, I don’t really get to do it on the ship, but… uh… I like baking. Baking is fun. Cooking’s fun too, and I help the chef sometimes, but… well, nothing beats a good cupcake, you hear me?”

“Other than that… uh… do you count picking fights as a hobby?” He laughs. “Sorry. It really is hard for me to escape the spectre of battle: I do genuinely enjoy it, and I’m annoying enough that most people I meet end up getting into a scuffle with me. I usually win, though,” he puffs his chest out with pride, a shit-eating smirk plastered across his face.

What is your vice? We all have our weaknesses, be it food, sex, gambling, collecting or stupid arguments over nothing. Some things just draw us in, seemingly irresistible despite our better judgement. What do you have trouble saying no to?

“My… wife……?” His face turns redder, and he has an embarrassed look about him. “I… can’t say no to him, alright. Who can?”

He shakes his head, as though that’d make the feelings go away. “Uh. If it isn’t obvious enough, rage and battle are also vices of mine,” he laughs. “If you ask me, ‘You wanna go, bro?’, the answer is almost always a right hook directly to the face. Maybe a bottle or a chair, if I’ve got ‘em within arm’s reach. 爸 always said I can’t walk into a bar without getting thrown out, all bashed up and bloody.”

What don’t you want to do? Contrary to the saying, millions of people can be wrong. What is it that everyone else seems to like that you can’t stand. What activity can the group all agree to do that will make you say “have fun, I’ll be over here doing something that isn’t fucking unbearable” before walking away?

“Swimming,” he answers bluntly. “I get it. It’s funny and surprising and whatever-other-adjective for a pirate to be scared of water, but it is what it is. Either you shut the fuck up, get your ass outta my face and stop asking me to come swim with you, or I’ll tear ya a new one and let the sharks have a taste of that delicious blood.”

Who do you know? Everyone has connections. Family, friends, colleagues, lovers or ex’s, we all have attachments. Who is in your life that you care about? How do you know them and what is your relationship like?

“I know my wife.” He laughs. “He’s very well-connected, though I haven’t had the chance to meet his acquaintances because… uh… well, being a pirate means I’m always away from my dear! Haven’t seen him in a long while…… maybe next landfall’s gonna be somewhere he’s at. That’d be… nice,” he sighs.

“There was also this cute little thing back on my 妈’s ship. One of the medics—a nurse, I think? Name’s Kasei Yuki. She was still in training, last I checked. We got real close since, well, y’know, I fucking fight a lot, and she keeps me updated on whatever’s going on on the Marquise’s ship whenever possible.”

“And… well, this goes without saying, but I do care about my family. I mean, I don’t see them often–or at all, really, we don’t drop by 广东 too often–but… well, you always pay respect to those who made you this way, alright? 爸 may have been a bit distant, but he is still my dad, and he taught me these fucking moves. Sol… was Sol. Not talkative, but he’s very good at being unaffected by things—and being a shitass, to a certain degree. Could learn a thing or two.”

“But I gotta say my 大哥’s definitely been my… biggest influence. He’s always so… energetic. Optimistic. Really lived up to the family name,” he laughs. “Nothing could get him down, and when he did fall, he never stayed down. He probably moulded me into the person I am today single-handedly, y’know.”

Fuck that guy! Do you have any enemies or rivals? Are their factions you oppose, either on principle or because they have wronged you? Is there someone you want to be rid of, even if only because they are in your way? Is there a nation that you’d enjoy seeing get knocked down a peg? Who hates you, who do you hate, and why?

“As I’ve said,” he casually dusts off his shoulders, “ain’t ever walked into a bar without getting thrown out for starting a fight. Don’t think those are… lasting, though—in the sense that I’ve made genuine enemies from that. And it’s mutual: I’ve mostly forgotten the people who I’ve tussled with.”

He pauses for a moment. “I guess there is one guy I’ve got slight beef with, but it surprisingly isn’t, like, physical beef. A certain Juno Mars: part of a powerful family of the empire’s foremost engineers where my wife’s from. Y’see, my wife’s family, uh, doesn’t like me, and would’ve much preferred him to marry up-and-coming Juno there. Obviously that didn’t happen, but I’m pretty sure they’re still trying to get him to, like, ditch me to get with him.” He frowns. “Not to say Juno likes me either. He’s a well-bred, level-headed guy from a rich family—inevitably, we clash heads a lot. It’s good that I don’t see him often, eh?” He grins.

AHHHH! MAKE IT GO AWAY! What are your greatest fears? Everyone has fears. Some fears are primal and basic, others are complex, tied to our experiences and needs. Some trigger a primitive fight or flight instinct, while others cause your stomach to sink and fill you with dread. What are you afraid of?

“Water,” he answers bluntly. “I nearly drowned, and I’d like to not drown again, thanks a lot. That wasn’t fun.”

Who are you? It’s a simple question but one which rarely has a simple answer. People define themselves in many ways, by names, associations, roles, professions, titles, passions or quirks. How do you see yourself? What kind of person do you see yourself as, and how does it compare to the person you aspire to be? How is the person you present yourself as different from the way you see yourself when being honest with yourself?

“You… don’t actually know it? Huh.” He leans back. “My interviewers usually already know me—sometimes better than I myself do.” He snicker.

“Nova. 阳诺洼, but I doubt you can pronounce that properly, so just stick to Nova.”

He leans back, a smug little smirk on his face. “I… am the best worst thing and the worst best thing to have ever come your way.” The smirk turns into a grin. “I’m cool, I’m handsome, I’m strong, and I can definitely beat your ass. What else do you wanna hear?”

What do you want? Some want to see their people rise to power and glory. Others want to see an enemy’s head on a pike. Some want to make the world a better place, and others just want to be rich and famous. We all have things we strive for, and want things that we may or may not actually think we should get. What are your goals that you pursue, and what are your desires?

“I want… to be… well, maybe not the best pirate–I mean, that’s a moot title, anyways; sometime in the future, someone else is gonna come along, and they’re gonna be called the best pirate, and then someone else comes along, and it’s basically just a never-ending cycle–but I wanna be a pirate that people remember. I want it to be, like, fifty years down the line, a hundred years down the line, and you’ll still hear people saying, ‘Oh, y’all remember that Nova Yang?’ and they’d reply, ‘Aw, yeah, dude, who can forget him?’”

“I wanna be a legend, my man. I want to leave behind a blazing legacy that people won’t forget so fucking easily.”

What do you have to hide? We all hide things from the world. Secrets, regrets, shame. What aspect of yourself and your life do you try to keep hidden from others? What do you try to hide even from yourself?

He turns this way and that, looking all around. The emptiness is still emptying. “Mmm… big secret, boss, but nothing ever leaves this hell-hole, so I guess there’s no harm in telling ya.” He shifts in his seat to lean closer to nothing in particular.

“My wife’s the youngest of the [[House of Aquarius|Ampora Family]]. Yeah, the purple fish nobles.” He leans back, a wide smirk on his face. “Cool, right? I’ve known him since I was, like, 9, maybe? He was the guy who saved me from drowning. Hit it off quite well after that—you should’ve seen him when he was younger. Wouldn’t speak above a whisper, would always hide behind me when we meet people…” he sighs. “Nothing like the confident, talented little minx he is nowadays.” He chuckles softly. “We were just friends at first, but…” he trails off. As the silence drags on, his face gets redder.

“Uh. But nothing. It’s none of your business why we’re married.“

What do you look like? Appearance is not just about your looks. What equipment do you carry? What clothes do you wear? Do you have any tattoos or jewellery? Do you have any unique physical traits such as a limp? Help you and the people at your gaming table better visualise your character. And don’t forget to describe your gear. Every long sword is unique, whether it’s magical or not.


He has a 关刀 (guandao) that his father gave to him before he left. Allegedly it’s a family heirloom, but Nova doubts it, since a) receiving it was the first time he ever saw it, and b) why has he never heard of the cool ancestor who wielded this thing before him. Standard Nova 关刀: wooden shaft painted gold, with a dragon carved all around it; the hilt is fashioned in the shape of a dragon’s head, a red cloth tied around it giving the illusion of the creature being blinded; it looks as though the dragon is spitting out the blade.

He does keep the rattan staff he used for much of his life, in case whatever he’s doing requires utmost non-lethality.

How do you fight? As you adventure you will run into conflicts. How do you settle your differences? What weapons does your character use? What power do they have? How do they fight? What is their style? What are they strong against and what are they weak against?

Nova’s weapon of choice are polearms, though he’s quite proficient in hand-to-hand combat as well. Being a human, he possesses no power—unless you count arson as a superpower. He carries with him a lighter at all times, and has little vials of oil he’d bring with him if wherever he’s going isn’t very flammable.

Nova has a very brutal fighting style. It focuses on beating his opponents into submission through sheer force. Not to say he doesn’t know how to fight tactically, but he typically only starts putting all the mental martial arts training to use when the going gets really tough.

What is your worldview? How has your upbringing affected your worldview? What is their response to authority? Describe your view of the world in plain terms. Are people good? Are the gods just? Are hotdogs sandwiches?

“Eh, who gives a shit? Fuck authority, though.” He spits. “AIn’t nobody telling me what to do. And I mean nobody: not the government, not my dad, not my mom.” He harrumphs. A bit after, his expression drops. “Well, maybe my wife can. I mean, fine,” he holds his hands up, “I’ll admit it, I do whatever a pretty lady tells me to,” he grins.

“But in all seriousness, I don’t… really give a shit about this whole, uh, morality and justice and the dichotomy of good and evil crap. I just care about whether or not I can beat you to a pulp.” He pauses. “Though, of course, I still have standards, y’know: if, like, a four-year-old came up to me and said, ‘Hey, Mister, I wanna fight you’, I’d just laugh and tell him to grow up a bit first, then we’ll talk.” He laughs for a good minute.

How do you fit in? How did you meet your adventuring companions? How do you contribute to the team? What is your role on the ship? How do you work in a team? (Be aware that even if you’re Satan, you need to be motivated to be with the party.)

After he decided he’s gotten used to a pirate’s life at sea, he left his mother’s ship in search for an unaffiliated crew, not wanting to be stuck in her shadow. He happened to be present when the crew were on the verge of a bar fight. He gleefully joined in–and may have, in fact, been the straw that broke the camel’s back–and got all of them thrown out. Still, his relative unscathedness compared to those who met his fists meant he was a formidable fighter, and he showed an almost-desperate eagerness to be part of the crew, willing to accept lower wages and increased workload. (??? To be reworked later, I guess??? I’m not entirely sure about this.)

One of the handful of generic thugs on the ship, Nova scrubs the deck and hoists the sails when it’s his turn, but what he’s really good at is fighting, especially close quarter combat. They say he oftimes volunteers for kitchen duty to avoid the menial tasks he dislikes, such as whatever would put him closer to the sea. Not that anyone complains; he cooks pretty well.

While Nova’s hot-headed and stubborn to a fault, he prefers to leave the thinking to people with more brains than him, willing to go along with most things. He’s also a formidable force in combat, willing to throw himself willy-nilly into battle, with a ferocity and bloodthirst that rivals none.

Why are you loyal to your Captain? Why did your Captain recruit you? How has he earnt your loyalty? Would you die for him or your crew? Come up with a bonding scenario in your backstory that connects your characters together in a meaningful way.

“Loyal?” He laughs. “I’m… not really loyal, bud. I ain’t gonna turn tail at the first sight of danger, but if the going gets tough, well, I’m putting myself first. Still, every legend has to start somewhere, so if it’s here I get my start, then it’s here I’ll be. I mean, I sure as hell ain’t going back to 妈.”

“‘Sides, I get to drink with people without starting a fight.” He pauses. “Well, more like ‘drink with people who will stop drunk me from putting my fists in someone’s face rather than return it’. I mean, listen, I love fighting, I absolutely do, but sometimes I want booze. Unfortunately, when you’re drunk me, uh, that lack of inhibition combined with an already lax inhibition does not bode well.”

What is your favourite colour? Answer this however you like, in as much detail as you like.

“Gold. Any bright shade of yellow, really, but gold’s preferable,” He smiles. “It’s the, ah, house colour, I guess. I mean, not really. We’re not, like, some royal family, but… well, we like yellow, alright? It looks good on us, and it’s an auspicious colour.” He pauses with pursed lips. “Well, Xing would object to the former–she and 妈 thinks blue looks nicer–but… meh. I mean, blue is a nice colour, and I’m not gonna say no to blue, but I like yellow better, and my other sibs think so too, so… yeah.”

“...But……” he lifts the bandana around his neck to his face, closing his eyes as he takes a whiff of its scent, “violet… violet is an amazing colour too.” There’s a hint of a blush on his cheeks as he drops the cloth.
