[[Tauhu]]'s Char
[[26. Curse of Strahd 2]]

[[Davian Martikov]]
Davian is an old and suspicious man. Davian and the rest of the [[Keepers of the Feather]] supply the cities of [[Krezk]] and [[Vallaki]] with their special brand of magically-brewed wine, in order to provide some form of happiness to the people of [[Barovia]]. 

[[Adrian Martikov]]
Adrian is the heir to the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery. He and his wife Muriel have one child, Katarina. He is a gracious and generous man who does all he can to honour the Martikov family name. Unlike so many others in [[Barovia]], he keeps an optimistic and positive outlook on things, even during dire circumstances. Adrian works hard at the Winery, making deliveries by cart despite the obscuring fog and dangers found along the road. 

[[Muriel Vinshaw]]
Muriel is perhaps the most active of the non-Martikov members of the Order of the Feather, and can be found exploring the various nooks and crannies of [[Barovia]] for clues that could help her cause. Naturally shy, but curious, she maintains her raven form while monitoring the characters throughout [[Barovia]], appearing from time to time and assisting them if she believes they need help. Muriel dyes the tips of her wings blue, a vain practice that could endanger her. 

[[Katrina Martikov]]
Katarina. A young adult, Kat is not yet married, and lives with her father Adrian at the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery. Kat is a bold adventurer and fighter. She is an active member of the rebel Movement, helping on many missions around the valley.

[[Stephanie Tomescu]]
Stefanie, is the 2nd child of Davian. Her husband, [[Dag Tomescu]], was inducted into the Keepers and allowed to become a wereraven after his marriage to Stefania. Stefania runs the less tangible aspects of running the [[Wizard of Wines]] and [[Keepers of the Feather]], such as accounts and code creation. Stefania and Dag live with their four children at the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery.

[[Dag Tomescu]]
Dag was inducted into the Keepers and allowed to become a wereraven after his marriage to [[Stefania Martikov]]. Stefania and Dag live with their four children at the [[Wizard of Wines Winery]].

[[Claudiu Tomescu]]
As the oldest of [[Davian Martikov]]'s grandchildren, Claud is currently in the position of messenger, ferrying orders and reports between his uncles, grandpa, and the members of the [[Keepers of the Feather]] in the field.

[[Martin Tomescu]]
Martin is the more mild-mannered of the Tomescu twins, and is often led into trouble by his two brothers.

[[Viggo Tomescu]]
Viggo is the more curious of the Tomescu twins, often getting into trouble at the Wizard of the Wines.

[[Yolanda Tomescu]]
The baby of the Tomescu kids, Yolanda largely just runs after her siblings (and cousins when around) until they make her go back to the main house.

[[Urwin Martikov]]
Urwin had a falling out with his father at some point and moved to [[Vallaki]], where he eventually assumed ownership of the inn that had previously belonged to Danika's father. Urwin is the chef in the family and prepares most of the meals. He occasionally receives help from his two boys, but they are easily distracted. 

[[Danika Martikov]]
Danika married into the order, joining the Martikov family through her marriage to [[Urwin Martikov]]. After Urwin and his father Davian had a falling out, Urwin and Danika moved to [[Vallaki]]. There, they took over management of the [[Blue Water Inn]], which had previously belonged to Danika's father. Danika and Urwin have two children, Brom and Bray.

[[Brom Martikov]]
Brom is an awkward young man, often fumbling through conversations. He flusters easily, especially when dealing with blunt individuals. However, despite this, he has confidence in his abilities, and is willing to help those in need. He helps his father as a server in the Inn.

[[Bray Martikov]]
Bray is a wereraven, though he is too young to be a true member of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. He, his parents, and his older brother Brom live at the [[Blue Water Inn]] in [[Vallaki]].


[[Elvir Martikov]]
Elvir is the youngest son of Davian and [[Alma Martikov]], Elvir is not yet married and lived until recently with his father at the [[Wizard of Wines]] Winery. Elvir is a very well travelled adventurer and tasked with the printing and distribution of pamphlets to help motivate the populace of [[Barovia]] to rise up against Strahd.
